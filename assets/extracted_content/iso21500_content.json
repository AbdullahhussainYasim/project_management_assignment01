The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO \ntechnical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been \nestablished has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and \nnon-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International \nElectrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.\nInternational Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.\nThe main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards \nadopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an \nInternational Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.\nAttention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent \nrights.

Achievement of the project objectives requires the \nprovision of deliverables conforming to specific requirements. A project may be subject to multiple constraints, \nas described in 3.11.\nAlthough many projects may be similar, each project is unique. Project differences may occur in the following:\n— deliverables provided; \n— stakeholders influencing; \n— resources used; \n— constraints; \n— the way processes are tailored to provide the deliverables.\nEvery project has a definite start and end, and is usually divided into phases, as described in 3.10. The project \nstarts and ends as described in 4.3.1.\n© ISO 2012 – All rights reserved \n3\nLicensed to Project PRACTICE / Ms. Islamova\nISO Store order #: 10-1295078/Downloaded: 2012-09-26\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited\n",
    "10": " \nISO 21500:2012(E)\n3.3 Project management\nProject management is the application of methods, tools, techniques and competencies to a project. Project \nmanagement includes the integration of the various phases of the project life cycle, as described in 3.10.\nProject management is performed through processes. The processes selected for performing a project should \nbe aligned in a systemic view. Each phase of the project life cycle should have specific deliverables. These \ndeliverables should be regularly reviewed during the project to meet the requirements of the sponsor, customers \nand other stakeholders.\n3.4 Organizational strategy and projects\n3.4.1 Organizational strategy\nOrganizations generally establish strategy based on their mission, vision, policies and factors outside the \norganizational boundary. Projects are often the means to accomplish strategic goals. An example of a value \ncreation framework is shown in Figure 2.\nOpportunity 1\nOpportunity 2\nOpportunity 3\nStrategy\nProjects\nBenefits\nIdentify\nSelect\nContribute\nFigure 2 — Example of a value creation framework\nStrategic goals may guide the identification and development of opportunities. Opportunities selection includes \nconsideration of various factors, such as how benefits can be realized and risks can be managed.\nThe project goal is to provide measurable benefits that contribute to realizing the selected opportunities. \nThe project objective contributes to the project goal by creating the required deliverables. Project goals are \nachieved when the benefits are realized. Goals might not be achieved until a period of time after the objectives \nare achieved.\n3.4.2 Opportunity evaluation and project initiation\nOpportunities may be evaluated to support informed decision-making by responsible management, in order to \nidentify feasible projects that could transform some or all of these opportunities into realized benefits.\nThese opportunities may address, for example, a new market demand, a current organizational need or a \nnew legal requirement. The opportunities are often evaluated through a set of activities that provide formal \nauthorization to start a new project. The organization should identify a project sponsor to be responsible for \nproject goals and benefits.\nThe goals and benefits may result in a justification for the investment in the project, e.g. in the form of a \nbusiness case, and that may contribute to a prioritization of all opportunities. The purpose of the justification is \nusually to obtain organizational commitment and approval for investment in the selected projects.\nThe evaluation process may include multiple criteria, including financial investment appraisal techniques and \nqualitative criteria, such as strategic alignment, social impact and environmental impact. Criteria may differ \nfrom one project to another.\n3.4.3 Benefits realization\nBenefits realization is generally the responsibility of organizational management, which may use the deliverables \nof the project to realize benefits in alignment with the organizational strategy. The project manager should \nconsider the benefits and their realization as they influence decision-making throughout the project life cycle.\n4 \n© ISO 2012 – All rights reserved\nLicensed to Project PRACTICE / Ms. Islamova\nISO Store order #: 10-1295078/Downloaded: 2012-09-26\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited\n",
    "11": " \nISO 21500:2012(E)\n3.5 Project environment\n3.5.1 General\nThe project environment may impact project performance and success. The project team should consider \nthe following:\n— factors outside the organizational boundary, such as socio-economic, geographical, political, regulatory, \ntechnological and ecological;\n— factors inside the organizational boundary, such as strategy, technology, project management maturity, \nresource availability, organizational culture and structure.\n3.5.2 Factors outside the organizational boundary\nFactors outside the organizational boundary may have an impact on the project by imposing constraints \nor introducing risks affecting the project. Although these factors are often beyond the control of the project \nmanager, they should still be considered.\n3.5.3 Factors inside the organizational boundary\n3.5.3.1 General\nA project usually exists inside a larger organization encompassing other activities. In such cases, there are \nrelationships between the project and its environment, business planning and operations. Pre-project and \npost-project activities may include activities such as business case development, conducting feasibility studies \nand transition to operations. Projects may be organized within programmes and project portfolios. Figure 3 \nillustrates these relationships.\nFigure 3 — Projects, programmes and project portfolios\n3.5.3.2 Project portfolio management\nA project portfolio is generally a collection of projects and programmes and other work that are grouped together \nto facilitate the effective management of that work to meet strategic goals. Project portfolio management is \n© ISO 2012 – All rights reserved \n5\nLicensed to Project PRACTICE / Ms. Islamova\nISO Store order #: 10-1295078/Downloaded: 2012-09-26\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited\n",

Programme \nmanagement consists of centralized and coordinated activities to achieve the goals.\n3.6 Project governance\nGovernance is the framework by which an organization is directed and controlled. Project governance includes, \nbut is not limited to, those areas of organizational governance that are specifically related to project activities.\nProject governance may include subjects such as the following:\n— defining the management structure; \n— the policies, processes and methodologies to be used; \n— limits of authority for decision-making; \n— stakeholder responsibilities and accountabilities; \n— interactions such as reporting and the escalation of issues or risks. \nThe responsibility for maintaining the appropriate governance of a project is usually assigned either to the \nproject sponsor or to a project steering committee.\n3.7 Projects and operations\nProject management fits within the general framework of management. Project management differs from other \nmanagement disciplines by the temporary and unique nature of projects.\nOrganizations perform work to achieve specific goals. Generally, this work may be categorized as either \noperations or projects. Operations and projects differ primarily as follows:\n— operations are performed by relatively stable teams through ongoing and repetitive processes and are \nfocused on sustaining the organization;\n— projects are performed by temporary teams, are non-repetitive and provide unique deliverables.\n3.8 Stakeholders and project organization\nThe project stakeholders, including the project organization, should be described in sufficient detail for the \nproject to be successful. The roles and responsibilities of stakeholders should be defined and communicated \nbased on the organization and project goals. Typical project stakeholders are shown in Figure 4.\nStakeholder interfaces should be managed within the project through the project management processes \ndescribed in Clause 4.\nThe project organization is the temporary structure that includes project roles, responsibilities and levels of \nauthority and boundaries that need to be defined and communicated to all stakeholders of the project. The \nproject organization may be dependent on legal, commercial, interdepartmental or other arrangements that \nexist among project stakeholders.\nThe project organization may include the following roles and responsibilities:\na) \nthe project manager, who leads and manages project activities and is accountable for project completion;\n6 \n© ISO 2012 – All rights reserved\nLicensed to Project PRACTICE / Ms. Islamova\nISO Store order #: 10-1295078/Downloaded: 2012-09-26\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited\n",

Any identified gap between the available and required competence levels \nrepresented on the project team could introduce risk and should be addressed.\nProject management competencies can be categorized into, but are not limited to, the following:\n— technical competencies, for delivering projects in a structured way, including the project management \nterminology, concepts and processes defined in this International Standard;\n© ISO 2012 – All rights reserved \n7\nLicensed to Project PRACTICE / Ms. Islamova\nISO Store order #: 10-1295078/Downloaded: 2012-09-26\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited\n",

These phases \nshould follow a logical sequence, with a start and an end, and should use resources to provide deliverables. In \norder to manage the project efficiently during the entire project life cycle, a set of activities should be performed \nin each phase. Project phases are collectively known as the project life cycle.\nThe project life cycle spans the period from the start of the project to its end. The phases are divided by \ndecision points, which can vary depending on the organizational environment. The decision points facilitate \nproject governance. By the end of the last phase, the project should have provided all deliverables.\nTo manage a project throughout its life cycle, project management processes should be used for the project as \na whole or for individual phases for each team or sub-project.\n3.11 Project constraints\nThere are several types of constraints and, as constraints are often interdependent, it is important for a project \nmanager to balance a particular constraint against the others. The project deliverables should fulfil the requirements \nfor the project and relate to any given constraints such as scope, quality, schedule, resources and cost. Constraints \nare generally interrelated such that a change in one may affect one or more of the other constraints. Hence, the \nconstraints may have an impact on the decisions made within the project management processes.\nAchievement of consensus among key project stakeholders on the constraints may form a strong foundation \nfor project success.\nSome constraints could be the following:\n— the duration or target date for the project;\n— the availability of the project budget;\n— the availability of project resources, such as people, facilities, equipment, materials, infrastructure, tools \nand other resources required to carry out the project activities relating to the requirements of the project;\n— factors related to health and safety of personnel;\n— the level of acceptable risk exposure;\n— the potential social or ecological impact of the project;\n— laws, rules and other legislative requirements.\n3.12 Relationship between project management concepts and processes\nProject management is accomplished through processes utilizing the concepts and competencies described \nin 3.1 to 3.11. A process is a set of interrelated activities. Processes used in projects are generally categorized \ninto three major types:\n— project management processes, which are specific to project management and determine how the \nactivities selected for the project are managed;\n— delivery processes, which are not unique to project management, which result in the specification and provision \nof a particular product, service or result, and which vary depending on the particular project deliverable;\n8 \n© ISO 2012 – All rights reserved\nLicensed to Project PRACTICE / Ms. Islamova\nISO Store order #: 10-1295078/Downloaded: 2012-09-26\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited\n",

However, it should be noted that \nproduct, support and project management processes might overlap and interact throughout a project.\n4 Project management processes\n4.1 Project management process application\nThis International Standard identifies the recommended project management processes to be used during \na project as a whole, for individual phases or both. These project management processes are appropriate \nto projects in all organizations. Project management requires significant coordination and, as such, requires \neach process used to be appropriately aligned and connected with other processes. Some processes may be \nrepeated to fully define and meet stakeholder requirements and reach agreement on the project objectives.\nProject managers, in conjunction with other project stakeholders, are advised to carefully consider the \nprocesses identified in 4.3 and apply them as appropriate to the project and organizational needs.\nThe processes described in 4.3 need not be applied uniformly on all projects or all project phases. Therefore, \nthe project manager should tailor the management processes for each project or project phase by determining \nwhat processes are appropriate and the degree of rigor to be applied for each process. This tailoring should be \naccomplished in accordance with the relevant organizational policies.\nIn order for a project to be successful, the following actions should be accomplished:\n— select appropriate processes described in 4.3 that are required to meet the project objectives;\n— use a defined approach to develop or adapt the product specifications and plans to meet the project \nobjectives and requirements;\n— comply with requirements to satisfy the project sponsor, customers and other stakeholders;\n— define and manage the project scope within the constraints, while considering the project risks and \nresource needs to provide the project deliverables;\n— obtain proper support from each performing organization, including commitment from the customers and \nproject sponsor.\nThe project management processes in this International Standard are defined and described in terms of the \npurposes they serve, the relationships among the processes, the interactions within the processes and the \nprimary inputs and outputs associated with each process. In the interest of brevity, this International Standard \ndoes not indicate the source of all primary inputs or where primary outputs go.\n4.2 Process groups and subject groups\n4.2.1 General\nThe project management processes may be viewed from two different perspectives: \n— as process groups (see 4.2.2) for the management of the project; \n— as subject groups (see 4.2.3) for collecting the processes by subject. \nThese two different groupings are shown in Table 1.

These plans may be \nseparate documents or combined into one document, but regardless of which option is chosen, the project \nplans should reflect the integration of scope, time, cost and other subjects.\nThe project management plan is a document or set of documents that defines how the project is undertaken, \nmonitored and controlled. The project management plan may be applied to the entire project as a whole or to \nsome part of the project through subsidiary plans, such as a risk management plan or quality management \nplan. Typically the project management plan defines the roles, responsibilities, organization and procedures for \nthe management of risk, issues, change control, schedule, cost, communication, configuration management, \nquality, health, environment, safety and other subjects as needed.\nThe project plan contains baselines for carrying out the project, e.g. in terms of scope, quality, schedule, costs, \nresources and risks.
