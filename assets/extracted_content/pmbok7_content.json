In 1969,\na few of those people formed a not-for-profit\norganization named Project Management\nInstitute (PMI).\n1.1. The certification program\nBesides organizing events and bringing\nproject managers together, in 1984, PMI\nalso created a certification program called\nProject Management Professional (PMP),\nwhich is still one of the best-known and most\ndesirable certifications in this domain.\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n6\n",

It became one of the main\nresources for the PMP exam, although not\nthe only one.\nFollowing on from a white paper in 1987, the\nfirst edition was published in 1996, and\nsince then, there has been a new edition\nevery four or five years:\n1996: PMBOK Guide\n2000: PMBOK Guide, 2000 edition\n2004: PMBOK Guide, 3rd edition\n2008: PMBOK Guide, 4th edition\n2013: PMBOK Guide, 5th edition\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n7\n",

Understanding and\nInterpreting\nA few years ago, I was reading a collection\nof essays by the famous physicist, Richard\nFeynman, in which he explained a problem\nhe called Cargo Cult Science. I couldn’t\nstop wondering how well that explains a\nfundamental problem we have in project\nmanagement when I was reading it. So, let\nme explain:\nThere were a few isolated tribes of people in\nNew Guinea and a few other islands. During\nthe two World Wars, they saw cargo planes\nlanding and bringing goods for the\ntemporary military bases on their islands.\nSeeing those large human-made flying\nobjects was magical for them. Moreover, the\nsoldiers used to give away or trade some of\nthe cargo, which was fascinating to the\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n19\n",
    "20": "islanders.\nWhen the wars ended, there were no cargo\nplanes anymore, and the islanders wanted\nthem back. So, they built runways, control\ntowers, and mock planes. They wore\nwooden headphones with antennas,\nmarched around the mock airbase, and lit\nthe sides of the runways, thinking that these\nshould attract the flying cargo planes and\nconvince them to land.\nIn their mind, simulating what others were\ndoing was enough to have the same result.\nIn reality though, as you can imagine, it\nwasn’t enough to bring back the cargo\nplanes.\nDoesn’t that sound familiar?\nMany people look at successful projects and\nthen start imitating them.

This is specially\nthe case in many Agile projects, where they\nthink as long as they use the Scrum labels\nand have big boards with lots of sticky notes\non them, they are good Agilists.\nWhat’s missing in many projects is the\nessence of what we do and the real\ndynamics behind the scenes. The rituals,\ndocuments and everything else are not the\nend, but the means to the end.\nHaving principles is a way to bring the\nattention back to what we really need to\nhave. We think about the principles, and\nthen carry on producing various project\nmanagement outputs that serve different\npurposes without blindly imitating others.\nThat’s why the 7th edition of the PMBOK\nguide has become principle-based.\nPrinciples are the main content of PMBOK\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n21\n",

We’ll explore the PMBOK principles\nin detail in the rest of this chapter, and then\nwe’ll also have a short overview of principles\nfrom other resources to give a wider\nperspective.\n2.1. PMBOK 7 principles\nThere are 12 principles in PMBOK 7:\n1. Be a diligent, respectful, and caring\nsteward.\n2. Create a collaborative project team\nenvironment.\n3.

For\nsome reason, you can hear a lot of these\nsad stories in IT development projects,\nwhich is a reason why some of the newer\nmethods in IT development are against\nhaving a central project manager role.\nOn the other hand, we’ve all seen many\norganizations where they appoint the most\nsenior expert as the project manager\nbecause of their deep expertise in technical\naspects. Many even think that a good\ntechnical expert must be promoted to a\n(project) manager sooner or later. In these\ncases, the organization loses a great\ntechnical expert and gains a mediocre\nmanager.\n2.1.1.1. Promotion vs. career\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n24\n",
    "25": "change\nTo make things clear, we have to start with\nthe management concept. When a technical\nexpert becomes a manager, it’s not a\npromotion, but a change in career. Being\ngood at technical aspects doesn’t guarantee\nthat you can be a good manager because\nyou need a different set of skills and\nattitudes for management. In fact, many\npeople aren’t really comfortable having\nmanagement roles and prefer to remain\ntechnical – we’ve been ruining their\nprofessional lives by forcing them into those\npositions.\nA better way is to let technical people\nremain technical and seek other ways of\npromoting them, while in parallel investing in\nrecruiting and nurturing other people for\nmanagement positions. The latter can be\nenriched by undergoing higher education in\n(project) management as well.\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n25\n",
    "26": "2.1.1.2. A true project manager\nWe also need to rethink the role of project\nmanager. A proper project manager is not a\n“boss” (there are already enough bosses in\nevery organization), but rather a supporter\nwho helps create a safe and productive\nenvironment for the team members where\nthey can carry out their expert activities\nbetter. Project managers must be focused\non coordination, problem solving, conflict\nresolution, etc.\nMy usual advice is that if you feel that the\nlabel “project manager” has a negative\nconnotation in your organization because of\npast experiences, lose the label and simply\ncall it chief project facilitator. It helps\npeople who take that role by continuously\nreminding them of their main responsibility\nas well.\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n26\n",

Understanding the\ntechnical aspects\nSo, when you think of the project manager\nrole as a non-technical supporter rather than\na technical boss, it’s clear that we don’t\nexpect a project manager to plan and\ncontrol the project alone, because they can’t\nknow enough about the project to do so.\nTherefore, instead of doing those things by\nthemselves, we expect them to facilitate\nteam members to create well-formed plans\nand come up with proper responses to\ndeviations when needed. That’s proper\nproject management.\nShould project managers have technical\nknowledge?\nWe can think of three responses to this:\n1. Yes, project managers should have\ntechnical knowledge.\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n27\n",

The\nsecond one is a relatively modern, yet\nslightly conservative way of thinking,\ncompatible with what I explained before, and\nI believe we can say that PMI believes in it\nas well.

In doing so, you’re not just another\ntechnical expert chipping in, but your\nposition as a project manager may also give\nyou an advantage, which can gradually turn\nyou into one of those annoying project\nmanagers who micromanage everyone.\nThat’s why the third option of choosing a\nproject manager who doesn’t have technical\nknowledge can be preferable.\n2.1.1.4.

If\nyou’re such a project manager, note that the\nobjection is because they understand the\nproject manager as someone who’s\nsupposed to be the main technical decision\nmaker.\nSo, you should explain at the beginning that\nyou’re not going to be their decision maker,\nand that they are the technical experts\nresponsible for those decisions. You also\nneed to explain to them that you’re there to\nmake working easier, more pleasant, and\nmore productive for them.

That’s why we have a\ncertain process:\nRequirements → Deliverables → Activities\nMany plans start with activities or\ndeliverables.

Deliverable breakdowns\nAnother topic related to deliverables is that\nmost projects have too many deliverables,\nand it would be overwhelming if you tried to\nmanage them in a flat list. For this reason,\nmost methodologies use hierarchical\nbreakdowns for deliverables, where the\nproject is broken down into a few major\nelements, and those into their building\nelements and so on for a few more levels\nuntil you reach the level of detail required for\nthe project.

Level of sophistication\nHow you can implement a risk management\nsystem can vary widely. For example, the\nminimalist approach of P3.express has only\none artifact called the follow-up register,\nused for storing information about risks as\nwell as issues, change requests,\nimprovement plans, and lessons learned.\nThey are in the same place for two reasons:\n1.

To this end, you\nshould ensure that the portfolio\nmanagement layer of the organization\nmaintains a list of overall risks that impact\nmore than one project, along with their\nassociated risk responses, and makes it\navailable to all projects. Conversely, the list\nof risks from each project should be\navailable to the portfolio management level\nso they can frequently review and identify\nrisks that could impact multiple projects, and\nmove them from the project layer to the\nportfolio layer.\nYou may be wondering what to do if your\norganization doesn’t have a portfolio\nmanagement system. Unfortunately, there\nare countless problems that can arise when\nthere’s no portfolio management layer, and\nthere’s no solution for that other than\nimplementing proper portfolio management!\nHowever, if you’re a project manager in an\norganization that doesn’t want to have a\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n216\n",

Where to Go from Here\nI hope you’ve enjoyed this brief overview of\nthe PMBOK Guide, and especially the fact\nthat it was about the real essence of the\nPMBOK Guide rather than a one-to-one\nsummary of the content of the official\nmanual. If you check the manual, you may\nbe surprised to see topics that we’ve not\nexplicitly explored in this book, but don’t\nworry – their important elements are\ncovered implicitly throughout the book.\nMany people try to create a project\nmanagement system entirely based on the\nPMBOK Guide, and they fail simply because\nthat’s not the purpose of the Guide – it’s not\na methodology. That’s why my focus was on\nexplaining what it really is, and how you can\nuse it in your projects.\nThere are two ways you can get help from\nPMBOK® Guide 7th edition, Underneath the Surface\n218\n",
    "219": "the PMBOK Guide in your projects:\nThe first is to use the principles to\nunderstand, re-interpret, and evaluate\neverything in your projects.\nThe second is to use its performance\ndomains to tailor and enrich your\nmethodology.\nThat brings us to the topic of methodology,\nand that’s why we had a separate chapter to\nintroduce a few of them.\nIf you’re interested in learning more, here\nare a few ideas:\nStructured guides\nPMBOK Guide: You can buy a\ncopy of the official manual from\nyour favorite bookstore.\nAlternatively, if you become a\nmember of PMI, you can download\nall the publications for free.
