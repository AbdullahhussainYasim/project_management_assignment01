    "3": "Foreword\nNowadays, most organisations are experiencing unprecedented levels of change.\nChange has become a way of life for organisations that need to remain effective and\ncompetitive in order to thrive. It is essential to manage the inherent risk associated with\nchange and innovation.\nProjects bring together resources, skills, technology and ideas to deliver business\nbenefits or to achieve business objectives. Good project management helps to ensure\nthat these benefits or objectives are achieved within budget, within time and to the\nrequired quality.\nPRINCE is a project management method designed to provide a framework covering the\nwide variety of disciplines and activities required within a project. The focus throughout\nPRINCE is on the business case which describes the rationale and business justification\nfor the project. The business case drives all the project management processes, from\ninitial project set-up through to the finish of the project.\nMany organisations are employing the skills and services of external Suppliers, working\nalongside in-house resources, to enhance their ability to deliver successful projects.\nPRINCE provides a mechanism to harness these resources and enable the project team\nto work together effectively.\nPRINCE embodies many years of good practice in project management and provides a\nflexible and adaptable approach to suit all projects. I commend the PRINCE approach\nto you. May PRINCE help you to achieve successful outcomes to your projects!\nBob Assirati\nChief Executive, CCTA\n",

    "18": "1 Introduction\nPRINCE was established in 1989 by CCTA (the Central Computer and\nTelecommunications Agency). The method was originally based on PROMPT, a\nproject management method created by Simpact Systems Ltd in 1975. PROMPT was\nadopted by CCTA in 1979 as the standard to be used for all Government information\nsystem projects. When PRINCE was launched in 1989, it effectively superseded\nPROMPT within Government projects. PRINCE remains in the public domain and\ncopyright is retained by the Crown. PRINCE is a registered trademark of CCTA.\n1.1 Why use a project management method?\nProject failures are all too common – some make the headlines, the vast majority are\nquickly forgotten. The reasons for failure are wide and varied. Some common\ncauses are:\n*\nlack of co-ordination of resources and activities\n*\nlack of communication with interested parties, leading to products being\n*\ndelivered which are not what the Customer wanted\n*\npoor estimation of duration and costs, leading to projects taking more \ntime and costing more money than expected\n*\ninsufficient measurable\n*\ninadequate planning of resources, activities, and scheduling\n*\nlack of control over progress so that projects do not reveal their exact \nstatus until too late\n*\nlack of quality control, resulting in the delivery of products that are\n*\nunacceptable or unusable.\nWithout a project management method, those who commission a project, those who\nmanage it and those who work on it will have different ideas about how things\nshould be organised and when the different aspects of the project will be completed.\nThose involved will not be clear about how much responsibility, authority and\naccountability they have and, as a result, there will often be confusion surrounding\nthe project. Without a project management method, projects are rarely completed on\ntime and within acceptable cost – this is especially true of large projects.\nA good project management method will guide the project through a controlled,\nwell-managed, visible set of activities to achieve the desired results. PRINCE adopts\nthe principles of good project management to avoid the problems identified above\nand so helps to achieve successful projects. These principles are:\n* a project is a finite process with a definite start and end\n* projects always need to be managed in order to be successful\n*  for genuine commitment to the project, all parties must be clear about why\n  the project is needed, what it is intended to achieve, how the outcome is to\n  be achieved, and what their responsibilities are in that achievement.\n1.2\nWhat is PRINCE?\nPRINCE (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) is a structured method for effective\nproject management. It is a de facto standard used extensively by the UK Government\nand is widely recognised and used in the private sector, both in the UK and\ninternationally. PRINCE, the method, is in the public domain, offering non-proprietorial\nbest-practice guidance on project management. PRINCE® is, however, a registered\ntrademark of CCTA.\nThe key features of PRINCE are:\n * its focus on business justification\n*  a defined organisation structure for the project management team\n* its product-based planning approach\n* its emphasis on dividing the project into manageable and controllable stages\n* its flexibility to be applied at a level appropriate to the project.\n",
    "19": ".\n1.3     Benefits of using PRINCE\nPRINCE provides benefits to the managers and directors of a project and to an\norganisation, through the controllable use of resources and the ability to manage\nbusiness and project risk more effectively.\nPRINCE embodies established and proven best practice in project management. It is\nwidely recognised and understood, providing a common language for all\nparticipants in a project. PRINCE encourages formal recognition of responsibilities\nwithin a project and focuses on what a project is to deliver, why, when and for\nwhom.\nPRINCE provides projects with:\n* a controlled and organised start, middle and end\n* regular reviews of progress against plan and against the Business Case\n* flexible decision points\n* automatic management control of any deviations from the plan\n* the involvement of management and stakeholders at the right time and place\n  during the project\n* good communication channels between the project, project management, and\n  the rest of the organisation.\nProject managers using PRINCE are able to:\n* establish terms of reference as a pre-requisite to the start of a project\n* use a defined structure for delegation, authority and communication\n* divide the project into manageable stages for more accurate planning\n* ensure resource commitment from management is part of any approval to\n  proceed\n* provide regular but brief management reports\n* keep meetings with management and stakeholders to a minimum but at the\n  vital points in the project.\nThose who will be directly involved with using the results of a project are able to:\n* participate in all the decision-making on a project\n* if desired, be fully involved in day-to-day progress\n* provide quality checks throughout the project\n* ensure their requirements are being adequately satisfied.\nFor senior management PRINCE uses the ‘management by exception’ concept. They\nare kept fully informed of the project status without having to attend regular, time-\nconsuming\nmeetings.\nThere are many organisations providing training, consultancy and tools services for\nPRINCE, thus ensuring a competitive supply. In addition, there is an active user\ngroup dedicated to the support, promotion and strengthening of the method.\n",
    "20": "1.4     Structure of the manual\nThere are five major parts to this manual, as shown in Figure 1:\n* Introduction, presents the basic principles governing project management and\n  how PRINCE addresses them; it also shows how PRINCE fits with related\n  aspects such as programme management, quality management and the\n  management of risk\n* Components, explains and describes the major elements of project\n  management, such as organisation and control, and how PRINCE\n  incorporates them. These components represent the ‘raw materials’ of good\n  project management including quality management and the management of\n  risk.\n* Processes, describes the PRINCE process model, explaining what has to be\n done to manage the project by bringing together and applying the ‘raw\n materials’ in a successful manner\n* Techniques, explains the various techniques of project management which are\n  unique to PRINCE\n* Appendices, offers Product Outlines for PRINCE management products, role\n  descriptions, a more detailed explanation of Configuration Management and\n  a comparison of the Quality Systems standard, IS0 9001, and PRINCE.\nIn addition, there is a full Glossary of terms.\n1.5     Using the manual\nThis manual is aimed at people who will be playing a part in a PRINCE project, or\nwho wish to understand how PRINCE contributes to the project management\nprocess; this would include senior managers responsible for the overall direction of\na project, Project Managers, project auditors, quality assurance personnel and\nmembers of the project team. In addition, line managers of project personnel may\nfind it useful to gain an appreciation of their staff’s involvement in a project by\nFigure 1: Structure of the manual\nIntroduction\nComponents\nProcesses\nTechniques\nAppendices\n",
    "21": "reviewing the Introduction\nThis manual has been designed to provide a complete reference to the PRINCE\nmethod. As such, the entire manual provides essential reading for all Project\nManagers. However, the following is offered as a focus for specific groups:\n* for Project Managers coming to PRINCE for the first time\n   - read and understand the PRINCE in context and Overview of PRINCE\n     sections of An introduction to PRINCE to appreciate the overall approach\n     PRINCE takes to creating and managing the project\n   - read and understand the Components section (Chapters 3 – 11) in order to\n     familiarise themselves with the interaction between the components and\n     the processes\n   - use the process model, described in Introduction to Processes, as the basis\n     for planning a project and deciding on resource requirements.\n* for Project Managers already familiar with PRINCE\n   - read and understand the process model, described in the Processes section,\n     to appreciate the changes of emphasis and process-driven approach.\n* senior managers who will be involved in the project at Project Board level\n  should gain an appreciation of PRINCE and their roles within a project by\n  studying the Introduction, the Introduction to Processes, Organisation, and the\n  description of Directing a Project (DP) within the Processes section of the\n  manual.\n1.6     PRINCE terminology\nThere are some terms that have a specific interpretation within PRINCE. All terms,\nwords or phrases that are specific to PRINCE start with capital letters and have full\nexplanations given in the Glossary. For example, the term ‘Exception’ is used within\nPRINCE to mean ‘a situation where it can be forecast that there will be a deviation\nbeyond the tolerance levels agreed between Project Manager and Project Board’.\nThe following list of terms are the most important to understand with regard to\nPRINCE and are all included in the Glossary. Readers should familiarise themselves\nwith them to prevent any possible confusion when using PRINCE.\nProduct, Deliverable or Outcome is used to describe everything that the project has\nto create or change, however physical or otherwise these may be. Results of projects\ncan vary enormously from physical items, such as buildings and machinery, to\nIntangible things like culture change and public perception.\nCustomer is used to represent the person or group who has commissioned the work\nand will be benefiting from the end results.\nUser is defined as the person or group who will use or operate the final product. In\nsome situations, the Customer and User may be the same group of people.\nSupplier is used to mean the group which is providing specialist resources and\nskills to the project, or is providing goods and services, to create the project\noutcome required by the Customer and Users.\nBusiness Case is used to define the information that justifies the setting up,\ncontinuation or termination of the project. It answers the question ‘Why should this\nproject be done?’ It is updated at key points throughout the project.\n",
    "22": "2     An Introduction to PRINCE\n2.1    What is a project?\nPRINCE defines a project as:\n‘a management environment that is created for the purpose of delivering\none or more business products according to a specified business case’\nAnother definition of a project might be\n‘a temporary organisation that is needed to produce a unique and pre-define\noutcome or result at a pre-specified time using pre-determined\nresources’\nPRINCE additionally supposes that those responsible for the project will not have\nexperience of working together to produce a similar set of outcomes or results for\nthe same Customer in the past; that co-ordination between those working on the\nproject will need to be well organised; and that the responsibilities between those\nundertaking the work, those managing it and those sponsoring it will need to be\nclearly defined.\nA PRINCE project, therefore, has the following characteristics:\n* a finite and defined lifespan\n* defined and measurable business products\n* a corresponding set of activities to achieve the business products\n* a defined amount of resources\n* an organisation structure, with defined responsibilities, to manage the\n  project.\nEach project falls within a specific business context. A project may be stand-alone,\nor may be one in a sequence of related projects, or may form part of a programme\nor corporate strategy.\nA project, by its nature, is a temporary structure, created to achieve a specified\nbusiness benefit or objective.  When the work has been completed, the project is\ndisbanded.\n",
    "23": "Idea\nStudy\nTrigger\nSpecify\nDesign\nDevelop\nTest\nChange Over\nUse\nScrap\nFigure 2: Product and Project Life Cycles\nA project has a life cycle, which is the path and sequence through the various\nactivities to produce the final product. The term life cycle is also used to describe\nthe life of a product. The two should not be confused. Figure 2 shows how a\nproduct life cycle might start from the initial idea or conception, through to the\noperation of the product, finishing with the eventual scrapping of the product when\nit comes to the end of its usefulness. The project life cycle covers the tasks of\nspecifying and designing a product, through to its testing and hand-over into\noperational use. PRINCE cover the project life cycle plus some pre-project\npreparation.\n2.2   The scope of PRINCE\nFigure 3 shows where PRINCE fits into a business and project environment.\nPRINCE is not intended to cover all subjects relevant to project management. The\nproject management techniques and tools needed will vary according to the project\ntype and the corporate environment. There are also certain aspects of project\nmanagement that are well covered by existing and proven methods and are\ntherefore excluded from PRINCE. Examples of these aspects are:\n* people management techniques such as motivation, delegation and team\n  leadership\n* generic planning techniques such as Gantt Charts and Critical Path Analysis\n* risk management techniques\n* the creation and management of corporate quality management and quality\n  assurance mechanisms\n* business case management, budgetary control and earned value analysis.\n",
    "24": "Figure 3: The PRINCE Relationship with Projects and\nBusiness\nPRINCE covers the management of the project, and the management of the\nresources involved in carrying out the activities of the project. It does not cover the\nspecialist techniques involved in the creation of the products. This is the job of\nother methods, although PRINCE must interface with them to enable information\non such areas as estimating, for example, to be provided for project management.\nAlthough PRINCE is centred on the project, it begins before the project does by\npreparing the ground so that the project starts in an organised and controlled\nmanner.\nAnother often critical project area is procurement. PRINCE assumes that the project\nis run within the context of a contract. The contracting process is not included\nwithin the method itself. Contracting and procurement are themselves technical\nactivities (like software engineering) and can therefore be managed using the\nPRINCE method. If procurement or contracting is to be undertaken during the early\nstages of the project, changes may be needed to the Project Board and other parts of\nthe Project Management Team once these stages have been completed. For example,\nit may be appropriate to have a senior representative of the contractor organisation\nas a member of the Project Board (in the role of Senior Supplier).\nContract and procurement issues will also increase the importance of a complete\nand accurate Project Initiation Document (PID) which will need to be kept in line\nwith the text of the contract(s). Where PRINCE describes project roles, the\nconversion of these into formal job definitions for a particular project will also\nrequire careful attention, for example Project Assurance, the approval of Product\nDescriptions, and the allocation of risk ‘ownership’.\n",
    "25": "2.3    PRINCE in context\nPRINCE is designed to be used on any type of project in any environment. It\ncontains a complete set of concepts and project management processes that are the\nminimum requirements for a properly run and managed project. However, the way\nPRINCE is applied to each project will vary considerably, and tailoring the method\nto suit the circumstances of a particular project is critical to its successful use.\nPRINCE projects are always focused on delivering specified products to meet a\nspecified Business Case. There will be many higher level issues surrounding the\nproject. These will need to be dealt with by other methods and approaches, such as\nprogramme management. PRINCE is aimed at the middle ground between these\nhigher level, more strategic, issues and the specialist production processes\nunderneath project management.\nFew projects can be completed entirely in isolation. The outputs from one project\nmay be used as input by another project. There may be other dependencies between\nprojects, such as shared resources. PRINCE places strong emphasis on the products\nthat the project is required to deliver and so provides a firm basis for defining the\nboundaries.\nWithin any project there are various groups of people with an interest in the project and\nits outcome, including:\n* Customers who have commissioned the work and will be benefiting from\n   the end results\n*  Users who will use or operate the final product; the Customer and User may\n   be the same group of people in some situations\n* Suppliers who are providing specialist resources and/or skills to the project,\n   or are providing goods and services\n* Sub-contractors, who provide products or services to the Supplier.\nThe Customer/ Supplier environment assumes that there will be a Customer who\nwill specify the desired outcome, make use of the final products and (in most cases)\npay for the project, and a (prime) Supplier who will provide resources and skills to\ncreate that outcome. PRINCE is written from the standpoint that these two parties\ncome from separately managed areas and typically from commercially separate\norganisations. Where, as will often be the case, both Customer and Supplier have a\ncommon management, this will influence the composition of the Project\nManagement Team.\nWhatever the team composition, the Customer should always participate\n(throughout the project) in the creation and verification of products.\n2.4    Overview of PRINCE\nPRINCE is a process-based approach to project management. The processes define\nthe activities to be carried out during the project. In addition, PRINCE describes a\nnumber of components that are applied within the appropriate activities. Figure 4\nshows the components positioned around the central process model. Each\ncomponent is described in further detail, in the Components section of this manual,\nshowing how the particular subject affects project management and providing\nguidance on when and how to address the issues.\n",
    "26": "The PRINCE process model, shown in Figure 5, consists of eight distinctive\nmanagement processes, covering the activities from setting the project off on the\nright track, through controlling and managing the project’s progress, to the\ncompletion of the project. The common Planning process is used by many of the\nother processes.\nThroughout the process model there are various project management products that\nare the inputs and outputs of each process. Planning in PRINCE is product-based.\nEach product is identified, defined and its delivery is controlled. The\nresponsibilities for the various activities, decision-making and support\nrequirements are fully defined within the Processes section of this manual.\nThe product-based planning technique also enables the project to state the standard\nof quality to which each product must conform. In addition, quality testing\nmechanisms are specified in order to prove that the products are meeting their\nrequired quality standard. PRINCE describes a specific technique, Quality Review,\nwhich is particularly suitable for the quality testing of document-based products.\nThere is a wide range of additional testing techniques that might be appropriate for\nthe project. The Project Quality Plan and the Stage Quality Plans must state what\nthese are, when and how they will be applied and by whom.\nFigure 4: PRINCE Processes&Components\nmponents andComponents\nOrganisation\nPlanning\nControls\nStages\nManagement of Risk\nQuality in a project\nConfiguration\nManagement\nChange Control\nDirecting a Project\nStarting\nUp a\nProject\nInitiating\na\nProject\nCompleting\n& Starting\nStages\nControlling\na Stage\nManaging\nProduct\nDelivery\nClosing\na Project\nenvironment\n",

In addition, projects can be large and complex,\ndealing with novel or unusual factors. Risk is therefore a major factor to consider\nduring project management and PRINCE incorporates the management of risk into\nits processes.\nThe process model provides the flexibility to establish a number of Stages, each\nforming a distinct unit for management purposes. Each Stage has a defined set of\nproducts or outcomes, activities, a finite lifespan, resources and an organisation\nstructure. The completion of each Stage is determined by the satisfactory\ncompletion of the agreed products Stage boundaries need to be appropriate to the\nparticular project and may be chosen according to one or more of the following:\n* the sequence of delivery of the products\n* the grouping of products into self-consistent sets\n* the natural decision points for feedback and review.\nWhatever the nature or size of the project, PRINCE defines an Initiation Stage that\ncovers the planning and definition of the project. The Initiation Stage enables a\nmanagement review before making any commitment to later Stage(s) and their\nassociated resources and costs.\nIn some situations, a study might be required to investigate the situation and\ndetermine options for the way ahead. Using PRINCE, the optimum approach would\nbe to handle the study as a separate and distinct project, and then operate a second\nproject to implement the results of the study.\nFigure 6 shows the (relatively) simple life cycle for a study-type project. It has one\nProject Plan, Business Case and set of risks. The possible options may each vary\nenormously in their cost and timescales. Each option would have a different Project\nPlan, Business Case and set of risks. Having chosen the appropriate option, the\nsecond project would proceed with a straightforward set of project information.\n",
    "28": "Figure 6: Life Cycle of a Study Project\nPRINCE enables the project to capture and retain the business benefits that are the\ndriving force behind the project itself. The benefits are stated in the project’s\nBusiness Case. Benefits can take many different forms:\n* financial, in the form of additional profit or avoided costs\n* strategic, by providing a platform to move towards one of the organisation’s\n  strategic aims\n* legislative, by fulfilling some absolute requirement laid down by head office\n  or a government minister.\nThroughout a PRINCE project, the Business Case is reviewed and progress is\nmeasured against the defined benefits. During any project there are often\nopportunities to discover new benefits that may enhance the project’s outcome or\nindeed impact on another project. However, any deviations from the original\nBusiness Case must be controlled through the Project Board.\nDuring the project, the specification of products will inevitably need to change.\nThese changes need to be controlled as they can easily destroy the project’s chance\nof success. Controlling changes is linked to version control, a topic that is covered\nwithin PRINCE under Configuration Management. Configuration Management is\nan essential part of project control as it is focused on controlling the products being\ndelivered, knowing where they are at any point in time, what their status is, who is\nworking on them, and which is the latest version.\n",

The structure assumes that there will be a Customer who will specify\nthe desired outcome, make use of the outcome and probably pay for the project,\nand a (prime) Supplier who will provide the resources and skills to create that\noutcome. This assumption has a bearing on how the project is organised.\nThe Customer and Supplier may be part of the same corporate body or may be\nindependent of one another.\nEstablishing an effective organisational structure for the project is crucial to its\nsuccess. Every project has need for direction, management, control and\ncommunication. PRINCE offers an approach which provides these elements and is\nsufficiently flexible to be mapped to any environment.\nA project needs a different organisation structure to line management. It needs to be\nmore flexible and is likely to require a broad base of skills for a comparatively short\nperiod of time. The project is normally cross-functional, an involved partnership.\nThe project organisation combines people who are working full-time on the project\nwith others who have to divide their time between the project and other permanent\nduties. The Project Manager will have direct management control over some of the\nproject staff, but may also have to direct staff who report to another management\nstructure.\n",
    "31": "The management structure of those with a problem to be solved will very often be\ndifferent from that of those providing the solution. They will have different\npriorities, different interests to protect, but in some way they must be united in the\ncommon aims of the project. The management level that will make the decisions\nand the commitments on behalf of their interests is too busy to be involved on a\nday-to-day basis with the project.  But most projects need day-to-day management\nif they are to be successful.\nProject Board\nSenior\nUser\nExecutive\nSenior\nSupplier\nCorporate or Programme Management\nProject Manager\nProject\nAssurance\nProject\nSupport\nTeam\nLeader\nFigure 9: Project Management Structure\nThe PRINCE project management structure, which is shown above, consists of roles\nand responsibilities which bring together the various interests and skills involved\nin, and required by, the project.\nGood project management practice requires the fulfilment of a number of generic,\nwell-defined roles. For the project to be successful it is important to define these\nroles at the outset.\nA project is a temporary structure specifically designed to manage the project to its\nsuccessful conclusion to meet the requirements defined in the Project Brief. The\nstructure allows for channels of communication to decision-making forums and\nshould be backed up by job definitions which specify the responsibilities, goals,\nlimits of authority, relationships, skills, knowledge and experience required for all\nroles in the project organisation.\nAll the roles set out in Figure 9 need to be accommodated within job definitions. In\naddition, the relationship between people’s authority and responsibility within the\nproject and their normal management responsibility and authority needs to be\nunderstood by those concerned and documented in job definitions.\n",
    "32": "In order to be flexible and meet the needs of different environments and different\nproject sizes, PRINCE does not define management jobs to be allocated necessarily\non a one-to-one basis to people. PRINCE defines roles which might be allocated,\nshared, divided or combined according to the project’s needs. Associated with this\nis the concept that responsibilities for a role can be moved to another role or\ndelegated, but they should not be dropped.\nSome of the PRINCE roles cannot be shared or delegated if they are to be\nundertaken effectively. The Project Manager role cannot be shared, nor can the\nProject Manager or Project Board roles be delegated.\nCorporate cultures differ, but PRINCE can be used no matter what corporate\norganisation structure exists.\n4.1.1    The Project Manager and Project Team\nPRINCE provides for a single focus for day-to-day management of the project, the\nProject Manager, who has well-defined responsibilities and accountability. Figure 10\ngives an idea of the many facets to the role of Project Manager. The Project Manager\nneeds a project organisation structure which will take responsibility for some of\nthese facets and provide support in performing some of the other facets.\nStrategy\nCustomer\nTeam\nWork\nPlanning\nMonitoring\nLine\nManagement\nFunding\nCommunications\nQuality\nProduct\nStatus\nProduct\nVersus\nProject\nNeeds\nUser\nNeeds\nChanges\nPROJECT\nMANAGER\nFigure 10: The many facets of the Project Manager role\nTo meet these needs PRINCE provides a structure for a Project Management Team\nwhich supports:\n* roles for decision-makers\n* management by exception for the decision-makers\n* full- or part-time project management\n* controlled delegation of some day-to-day management responsibilities,\n  where required, to Team Managers\n* roles for the independent inspection of all aspects of project performance\n* administrative support, as required, to the Project Manager and Team\n  Managers\n* agreement by all concerned on what the various roles and responsibilities are\n* lines of communication between the Project Management Team members.\n",
    "33": "4.1.2    Four layers.\nPRINCE separates the management of the project from the work required to\ndevelop the products, and concentrates on the former.\nA fundamental principle is that the project organisation structure has four layers\nwhich undertake:\n* direction of the project\n* day-to-day management of the project\n* team management\n* the work to create the products, i.e. the team members.\nThe first three are known as the PRINCE Project Management Team.\nHints and tips for Project Management organisation\nContractual and commercial arrangements will often interfere with the ideal project\nmanagement organisation.\nThe project organisation structure should include links with the more permanent,\nfunctional or line management structures within both the Customer and Supplier\ncommunities.\n4.1.3   Three project interests\nPRINCE mandates the structure and composition of the Project Board as depicted in\nFigure 11. Three interests must be represented on the Project Board at all times.\nFigure 11: The Three Project Interests\nBusiness\nUser\nSupplier\n",
    "34": "Business\nThe product(s) of the project should meet a business need. The project should give\nvalue for money. There should, therefore, be representation from the business\nviewpoint to ensure that these two pre-requisites exist before commitment to the\nproject is made, and remain in existence throughout the project. PRINCE makes a\ndistinction between the business and the requirements of those who will use the\nfinal product(s). The Executive role is defined to look after the business interests\n(representing the Customer).\nUser\nThere will be an individual, group or groups for whom some or all of the following\nwill apply:\n* they will use the final product\n* the product will achieve an objective for them\n* they will use the end result to deliver benefits\n* they will be impacted by the outcome.\nThe User presence is needed to specify the desired outcome and ensure that the\nproject delivers it. User management should therefore be represented on the Project\nBoard.\nSupplier\nThe creation of the end product (and possibly its subsequent operation) will need\nresources with certain skills. Representation is needed from the Suppliers who will\nprovide the necessary skills. The Supplier may need to use both in-house and\nexternal teams to construct the final outcome.\n4.1.4    The Customer/Supplier environment\nPRINCE is defined in terms of a Customer/Supplier environment. There are many\ncombinations of Customer and Supplier that may affect the organisation and control\nof the project. Combinations worth considering are:\n* projects sponsored by a single Customer versus those supporting multiple\n   Customers\n* those projects which are supplied by a single source versus those with\n   multiple Suppliers\n* situations which involve a consortium of equal Customers and/or Suppliers\n   versus those which involve a ‘legal’ hierarchy of either:\n  - projects supplied by an in-house source (part of the parent organisation)\n  - those with a mixture of in-house and external Suppliers.\nThe project’s direction set by the Project Board must reflect the agreements and\ndecisions of the three interests.\nNOTE: Customer specialists may also be involved in setting the direction of the\nproject, especially in cases where the project is part of a programme.\nThe Project Board is the forum where senior management representatives of the\nCustomer and Supplier come together to make decisions and commitments to the\nproject. There may be times when the Customer management needs to meet without\nthe Supplier to discuss confidential matters or prepare a joint approach and vice\nversa. There may, therefore, be separate management groups as exemplified in\nFigure 12, but within PRINCE the Project Board is regarded as a joint forum.\n",

Their Project Board responsibilities will be in\naddition to their normal work, which makes it important that PRINCE offers them\nmanagement by exception, keeping them regularly informed, but only asking for\njoint decision-making at key points in the project.\n",
    "36": "The Project Board consists of three roles:\n* Executive\n* Senior User\n* Senior Supplier.\nThese roles should ideally be assigned to individuals who can stay with the project\nthroughout its life.\nThe Project Board is appointed by corporate or programme management to provide\noverall direction and management of the project. The Project Board is accountable\nfor the success of the project, and has responsibility and authority for the project\nwithin the remit (the Project Mandate) set by corporate or programme management.\nThe Project Board approves all major plans and authorises any major deviation\nfrom agreed Stage Plans. It is the authority which signs off the completion of each\nstage as well as authorising the start of the next stage. It ensures that required\nresources are committed and arbitrates on any conflicts within the project or\nnegotiates a solution to any problems between the project and external bodies. In\naddition, it approves the appointment and responsibilities of the Project Manager.\nThe Project Board is responsible for assurance that the project remains on course to\ndeliver products of the required quality to meet the Business Case defined in the\nProject Initiation Document. According to the size, complexity and risk of the\nproject, the Project Board may decide to delegate some of this project assurance\nresponsibility. Later in the chapter project assurance is discussed.\nThe Project Board is the project’s ‘voice’ to the outside world and is responsible for\nany publicity or other dissemination of information about the project.\n4.2.2    Executive\nThe Executive is ultimately accountable for the project, supported by the Senior\nUser and Senior Supplier. The Executive has to ensure that the project is value for\nmoney, ensuring a cost-conscious approach to the project, balancing the demands of\nbusiness, User and Supplier.\nThroughout the project the Executive ‘owns’ the Business Case.\n4.2.3    Senior User\nThe Senior User is accountable for making sure that what is produced is fit for its\npurpose and for ensuring that the solution meets User needs and falls within the\nconstraints of the Business Case.\nThe role represents the interests of all those who will use the final product(s) of the\nproject; those for whom the product will achieve an objective; and those who will\nuse the product to deliver benefits. The Senior User role commits User resources\nand monitors products against requirements. This role may require more than one\nperson to cover all the User interests. For the sake of effectiveness the role should\nnot be split between too many people.\n4.2.4    Senior Supplier\nThe Senior Supplier is there to ensure that proposals for designing and developing\nthe products are realistic in that they are likely to achieve the results required by the\nSenior User within the cost and time parameters for which the Executive is\naccountable. The role represents the interests of those designing, developing,\nfacilitating, procuring, implementing, operating and maintaining the project\nproducts. The Senior Supplier must have the authority to commit or acquire the\nrequired Supplier resources. The Senior Supplier has responsibility for the\nSupplier’s Business Case.\n",
    "37": "It should be noted that in some environments the Customer may share design\nauthority or have a major say in it.\nIf necessary, more than one person may be required to represent a range of\nSuppliers.\nHints and tips for the Project Board\nProject Board members are normally very busy outside the project, There is a\ndanger in larger projects that if they don ‘t delegate their assurance responsibilities,\nthese will not get done, If the assurance responsibilities are not delegated, Project\nBoard members must seriously consider how the work associated with these\nresponsibilities will get done, when they will find the time and how  well those\nresponsibilities will be carried out.\nRoles may be combined but never eliminated.\nThere will be questions of confidentiality or conflicts of interest.

    "38": "It is not advisable to combine the roles of Senior User and Senior Supplier because\nof potential conflict of interest. According to the project’s business environment,\nany combination of the owner and user roles should be considered carefully.\nProject Boards are the major decision-makers. It is important that the\nBusiness, User and Supplier are represented, because they all need to make\ncommitments to the project.\nThe Supplier may wish to establish an internal management board to debate and\nmanage internal aspects of the project without the presence of the Customer or\nUser.\nThe Supplier’s equivalent of the ‘Project Board’ may wish to appoint its own\nbusiness assurance role to monitor the Supplier’s Business Case.\nBoth the Customer and the Supplier may wish to appoint their own assurance\nroles. In particular, the Customer may feel the need for assurance about the specialist\naspects of the project independent of the Supplier.\nA large Project Board can become unwieldy and inhibit the decision-making process.\nIf there arc too many candidates for a Project Board role, they should be encouraged\nto appoint a spokesperson to carry out that role. In particular, if there are too\nmany wanting to share the Senior User role, a User Committee can be formed\nwith a Chairman. The Chairman represents them as Senior User, reports back to\nthe committee and takes direction from it before Project Board meetings.\nSuppliers should not be in a position to outvote the business/User representatives by\nsheer weight of numbers.\nOther interests can be invited to attend Project Board meetings to provide advice etc.,\nbut not to take part in the decision-making.\nAll Project Board members need training in project Board procedures and\nresponsibilities.\nWhere the project is one of a string of projects, a decision is needed on who is the\nuser. It is an end-user or is it the next project in the string?\nDon’t confuse the need for an organisation to manage the project with the need for\na communication vehicle.\nProject Board members should sign up to their agreed role and responsibilities\nbefore taking the job on.\nWhere the project is part of a programme, the Programme Director appoints the\nProject Board Executive and has the option of appointing the other Project Board\nmembers. Alternatively the Project Board Executive may be asked to select the\nother Project Board members. Where the latter is the case, the advice and approval\nof the programme Director should be sought.\n4.2.5    Project Manager\nThe Project Manager is given the authority to run the project on a day-to-day basis on\nbehalf of the Project Board within the constraints laid down by the board.\nThe Project Manager’s prime responsibility is to ensure that the project produces\nthe required products, to the required standard of quality and within the specified\nconstraints of time and cost. The Project Manager is also responsible for the project\nproducing a result which is capable of achieving the benefits defined in the Project\ninitiation Document.\nHints and tips for the Project Manager\nIt may be beneficial to employ high quality people part-time rather than lesser\nquality people full-time.\n",
    "39": "It is important to remember that the manual assumes the Project Manager will be\nfrom the Customer. It is possible that the Project Manager may be from the Supplier,\nie the interface boundary moves from Project Manager/Team Manager to Project\nBoard/Project Manager.\nWhere the Project Manager does not have direct authority over personnel required\nto work on the project, it is strongly recommended that the agreement of the\nappropriate managers is obtained (and maintained throughout the project) for the\ncommitment of their personnel.\nRemember that the Project Manager’s role is to manage the work, not do it.\nThe Project Manager must avoid becoming involved in low-level detail to the\nextent that sight is lost of the ‘big picture’, i.e. what is going on in every part of the\nproject.\nDifferent Project Manager attributes are needed for different types of project.\nIn tailoring the Project Manager and Team Manager roles in a Customer/ Supplier\nenvironment, consideration must be given to whether it is acceptable for Customer\nresources to be managed by a Supplier, or Supplier resources to be managed by the\nCustomer representative. If such a situation is permitted, the division of\nmanagement responsibilities for human resource management should be made clear,\ne.g. appraisals, promotion and training.\n4.2.6     Team Leader\nThe use of this role is optional. The Project Manager may find that it is beneficial to\ndelegate the authority and responsibility for planning the creation of certain\nproducts and managing a team of specialists to produce those products. There are\nmany reasons why the Project Manager may decide to employ this role. Among\nthese are the size of the project, the particular specialist skills or knowledge needed\nfor certain products, geographical location of some team members, and the\npreferences of the Project Board.\nThe Team Manager’s prime responsibility is to ensure production of those products\ndefined by the Project Manager to an appropriate quality in a timescale and at a\ncost acceptable to the Project Board. The Team Manager reports to and takes direction\nfrom the Project Manager.\nThe use of this role should be discussed by the Project Manager with the Project\nBoard and, if the role is required, planned at Project Initiation time.\n4.2.7    Project Assurance\nThe Project Board members do not work full-time on the project, therefore they\nplace a great deal of reliance on the Project Manager. Although they receive regular\nreports from the Project Manager, there may always be questions at the back of their\nminds, ‘Are things really going as well as we are being told?’, ‘Are any problems\nbeing hidden from us?’, ‘Is the solution going to be what we want?’, ‘Are we\nsuddenly going to find that the project is over-budget or late?’ There are other\nquestions. The Supplier and /or Customer may have a quality assurance function\ncharged with the responsibility to check that all projects are adhering to the Quality\nSystem.\nAll of these points mean that there is a need in the project organisation for\nmonitoring of all aspects of the project’s performance and products independent of\nthe Project Manager. This is the Project Assurance function.\nSpecific responsibilities\nThe implementation of the assurance roles needs to answer the question ‘What is to\n",
    "40": "be assured?’ A list of possibilities would include:\n* maintenance of thorough liaison throughout the project between the Supplier\n  and the Customer\n* User needs and expectations are being met or managed\n* risks are being controlled\n* expenditure and schedule\n* adherence to the Business Case\n* constant reassessment of the value-for-money solution\n* fit with the overall programme or company strategy\n* the right people are being involved\n* an acceptable solution is being developed\n* the project remains viable\n* the scope of the project is not ‘creeping up’ unnoticed\n* focus on the business need is maintained\n* internal and external communications are working\n* the needs of specialist interests, e.g. security, are being observed\n* adherence to quality assurance standards.\nIt is not enough to believe that standards will be adhered to. It is not enough to\nensure that the project is well set up and justified at the outset. All the aspects listed\nabove need to be checked throughout the project as part of ensuring that it remains\nconsistent with and continues to meet a business need and that no change to the\nexternal environment affects the validity of the project.\nPRINCE starts by identifying these Project Assurance functions as part of the role of\neach Project Board member. According to the needs and desires of the Project\nBoard, any of these assurance responsibilities can be delegated, as long as the\nrecipients are independent of the Project Manager and the rest of the team(s). Any\nappointed assurance jobs assure the project on behalf of one or more members of\nthe Project Board.\nIt is not mandatory that all assurance responsibilities are delegated. Each assurance\nresponsibility which is delegated may be assigned to one individual or shared. The\nProject Board decides when an assurance responsibility needs to be delegated, and\nthe delegation may be for the entire project or only part of it. The person or persons\nfilling an assurance role may be changed during the project at the request of the\nProject Board, Any use of other personnel to take on assurance responsibilities\nneeds to be planned at Initiation Stage, otherwise resource usage and costs for\nassurance could easily get out of control. Anyone appointed to an assurance job\nreports to the Project Board member responsible for the appointment.\nProject Assurance has to be independent of the Project Manager, therefore the\nProject Board cannot delegate any of its assurance responsibilities to the Project\nManager.\nHints and Tips for Project Assurance\nThe Project Board may carry out its own assurance roles if it so wishes and if\nthere is time.\nThe assurance required may vary according to the type of project. The lists given\nhere and earlier can be used to identify a need for a given project. One possible\nexample is the need to assure the continued business integrity of the project. This\nrole would monitor the continuing validity of the Business Case against external\nevents, changes to the project business risks, the evolution of actuals against the\nProject Plan and any impact on the Business Case of changes to the specification.\nAnother example is the regular assurance on behalf of the User or Customer that\nthe project is staying on track to produce an effective and usable solution. A third\nexample is that of assuring that the correct standards are available, are being used\nand are being used correctly in the development of the products. This might include\nassurance that there is an audit trail of all the quality control work being done.\n",
    "41": "Other examples would include security assurance, and assurance that the project\nis staying within programme strategy and guidelines.\nIf a role is changed during the project, care must be taken to ensure continuity of\nthe work being done by that role.\nIt is not advisable to combine any assurance roles where there would be potential\nconflicts of interest.\nAnyone appointed to an assurance role should be independent of the Project\nManager and Teams.\nIn Customer/Supplier projects there may be a need for two separate assurance\nroles to monitor the respective interests of the Customer and the Supplier.\n4.2.8 Project Support\nThe Project Manager may need administrative help. This may stem from the sheer\nvolume of work to be done or the mandated use of certain tools where the Project\nManager has insufficient expertise, such as in supporting, planning and control or\nConfiguration Management.\nThe provision of any project support on a formal basis is optional. It is driven by\nthe needs of the individual project and Project Manager. Project support could be in\nthe form of administrative services, advice and guidance to one or more related\nprojects, Where set up as an official body, project support can act as a repository for\nlessons learned and estimating metrics, and a central source of expertise in\nspecialist support tools. One support function which must be considered is that of\nConfiguration Management. Depending on the project size and environment, there\nmay be a need to formalise this, and it quickly becomes a task with which the\nProject Manager cannot cope without support. See the chapter on Configuration\nManagement for details of the work.\nIt is necessary to keep project support and assurance responsibilities separate in\norder to maintain the independence of project assurance.\nHints and tips for Project Support\nThe physical location of project staff can present problems if they are geographically\nremote from each other. If at all possible, choose people at a common location.\nAlternatively, ensure suitable communications technology and training in its use\nfire available.\nA project support organisation which serves all projects is an ideal way to establish\nand maintain a number of management standards, such as a common planning\nand control tool, the management of risk and Configuration Management.\n",
    "42": "Where the number of projects and size of staff warrant it, the common areas of\nsupport may be concentrated into a Project Support Office (PSO). This allows\nstaff to be permanently allocated to this type of work, and therefore become highly\nskilled at the activities. A Project Support Office can support all projects and set\nstandards, such as the use of planning and control tools, reporting, change control,\nConfiguration Management.\n4.3     Programme Organisation\nA programme is a portfolio of projects selected and planned in a co-ordinated\nway so as to achieve a set of defined business objectives.\nAlternatively r it can be a single, large or particularly complex project or\na set of otherwise unrelated projects bounded by a business cycle.\nOften, a project may be part of a programme. A programme would normally consist\nof many projects. An example of a programme is the building and commissioning of\na new hospital, where various projects would undertake construction of the\nbuilding and the road infrastructure, the procurement of equipment, staffing,\nprovision of communications, computer systems and many others.\nFigure 13 illustrates the programme management roles and their relationships with\nthe project organisation.\nThe management, direction and objectives of the programme influence each project.\nIn particular, when starting up the project, the programme management will have a\nsay in the selection of the project Executive. It is therefore necessary to understand\nthe organisation of a programme.\nFigure 13: Programme Organisation\nProgramme\nDirector\nProgramme Executive\nProject\nBoards\nTeam\nLeaders\nProgramme\nSupport\nProject\nManagers\nProject\nSupport\nProject\nAssurance\nProgramme\nManager\nBusiness\nChange\nManager\nDesign\nAuthority\n",
    "43": "Authority for a programme lies with the Programme Director. Authority for the\nday-to-day management of a programme is delegated to the Programme Executive.\nAt the programme level the assurance role is fulfilled by two roles within the\nProgramme Executive, namely the Business Change Manager and the Design\nAuthority. At the project level assurance is the responsibility of the Project Board\nmembers, who may delegate some or all of the role.\nThere are a number of lines of communication which may cause confusion. As the\ndiagram shows, information from the Project Manager may reach the Programme\nDirector via both the Programme Executive and the Project Board. This must be\nclarified in the job definitions and also in the control and reporting procedures.\n4.3.1 Programme Director\nThe Programme Director will have direct, overall control of the programme\nimplementation. This includes delegating the authority for projects to Project\nBoards.\nThe role of Programme Director may be part-time, but is responsible for:\n* establishing the programme and projects\n* Project Board appointments\n* securing resources\n* monitoring progress\n* ensuring the aims of the programme and projects continue to be aligned\n  with evolving business needs\n* ensuring the realisation of benefits.\nResponsibility for establishing the Project Board lies with the Programme Director.\nHowever, having appointed the project Executive, the Programme Director may\nchoose to delegate the appointment of the remainder of the Project Board and\nProject Management Team to the Executive, rather than making all the\nappointments personally, Whichever option is followed, serious consideration must\nbe given to the need for programme representation and the need for the project to\nbe seen to be locally owned, so allowing for the adoption of the project’s output by\nthe Customer and Users.\nThe above has an impact on Starting up a Project (SLI). If the programme Director\nhas already appointed the Project Board, then this removes the need to design and\nappoint the Project Board within the process.\n4.3.2 Programme Executive – Programme Manager\nThe Programme Manager carries out the day-to-day co-ordination of the\nprogrammers portfolio of projects on behalf of the Programme Director. To do this\nthe Programme Manager must ensure that an appropriate environment to support\nthe Project Managers is developed and maintained. Once projects are under way,\nthe Programme Manager focuses on monitoring changes within the project\nportfolio. This will include timely management of exceptions, slippage and issues of\npriority.\nThe programme Manager is responsible for ensuring the management of project-related\nrisks, particularly those associated with interdependencies between projects\nand with programme-wide risks.\nThe Programme Manager is the key link between programme and projects,\nproviding direction to the Project Managers on programme projects.\n4.3.3 Programme Executive – Business Change Manager\n",
    "44": "The Business Change Manager represents the Programme Director’s interests in the\nfinal outcome of the programme, and is the author and guardian of the final\nBusiness Case for funding the programme work. ‘Change’ in this sense is the\nchange to the customer’s way of doing business which will be brought about by the\nprogramme and projects. The role is responsible for the management of change\nactivities which must ensure that managers and staff in the target business area are\ninformed and involved throughout the life of the programme, and are fully\nprepared to exploit the new operational business environment once it is put in\nplace.\nThe Business Change Manager is responsible for assuring that the approach being\ntaken to manage risks is appropriate.\n4.3.4 Programme Executive – Design Authority\nThe Design Authority should ensure that, whatever procedures, systems or\ncomponents are implemented in projects which are part of the portfolio, their\ndesigns are consistent and the interfaces between projects are designed consistently.\nThe Design Authority also ensures that all project designs comply with the policies\nand standards and are consistent with the supporting services and infrastructures\nwhich they use or with which they interface. Where the impact of a design change is\nnot perceived at the project management level, the Design Authority should take a\nproactive role and achieve any necessary design changes to keep the programme\nmoving forwards.\nThe Design Authority monitors risks associated with the programme’s products.\n4.4     Alternative organisation structures\nWithin a programme the way in which individual Project Management Teams are\ndefined and how projects interface with a programme may differ from project to\nproject. The following may be considered for some or all of the projects within a\nprogramme.  The decision must be made during the start-up process of the project,\nand the roles and responsibilities for that project at both project and programme\nlevel defined clearly.\n4.4.1   Programme Executive as Project Board Members\nThere is a danger that the two levels of ‘business change management’ (programme\nand project) may lead to confusion. One of the ways to avoid this is to have\nprogramme representation on the Project Board. This may be done either by\nappointing a programme representative into a Project Board role or by having a\nrepresentative of programme management attend the Project Board meetings\nwithout taking a formal project role.\nFor example:\n* the Business Change Manager may take on the role of Senior User\n* the Programme Manager may take the Executive role on the Project Board\n* the Programme Manager may represent the programme at Project Board\n  meetings without taking a specific Project Board role\n* the members of the Programme Executive may\n  Board meetings between them.\nAdvantages\nWhere the individual takes a role on both programme and project, this might result\nin the joint role becoming full-time. This would allow the individual to concentrate\nsolely on the programme and project, rather than have other day-to-day\ndistractions.\n",
    "45": "The decisions made are more likely to reflect the central objectives of the\nprogramme.  As a result, the outputs from projects should be consistent across the\nprogramme.\nProject decisions which have a programme impact should be made more quickly.\nThe programme representative is more likely to be able to make a decision on the\nspot, rather than the project having to wait until the Programme Executive is\nconsulted. This should lead to a reduction in delays or re-work caused by having to\nwait for crucial decisions.\nThe programme is seen to be pro-active in a structured, rather than what might be\nperceived as a disruptive, meddling way.\nDisadvantages\nThe business area on which the project is focused may feel that the Project Board\ndoes not provide it with sufficient representation. This may lead to reluctance to\naccept the project’s products or failure to realise all the predicted benefits. To avoid\nthis situation the flexibility of the Project Board roles can be used to ensure\nrepresentation of both the programme and end users.\nIf the Business Change Manager is occupied full-time by having roles at both\nprogramme and project level, this person may be taken away from the relevant\noperational environment, thus becoming unaware of changes taking place within\nthe business.\nThere will be fewer perspectives than if the Project Board is staffed by individuals\nwho are not part of the programme organisation.\n4.4.2    Common Programme Support and Project Support Staff\nCertain functions performed by project support may be filled at programme level\nfor all projects within the programme. Examples of this would be expertise in the\nplanning and control method and software, the management of risk, change control\nand Configuration Management.\nThis assumes that programme and support staff are situated on the same site.\nAdvantages\nReduction in the duplication of support staff required. A single member of staff may\nbe made responsible for collating all the information for a single area such as risks.\nThe effort needed to maintain Risk Logs across projects will be reduced (or several\npart-time jobs combined to form one full-time job). Any risks which impact the\nprogramme will be identified during appraisals of project risks.\nReduction in the number of experts required. It may be unreasonable or impossible\nto obtain expertise for each project in Configuration Management or the planning\nand control tool being used. The problem can be alleviated by concentrating\nsupport at programme level.\nCentral support ensures consistency in the tools being used, the standardised layout\nof reports and easier summary of reports to programme management.\nWhere there is continuation of the use of a tool or method into the eventual use of\nthe project’s products, such as Configuration management, centralisation of support\nhelps ensure a smooth passage from projects to operation.\nDisadvantages\n",
    "46": "If the projects are geographically dispersed, central support may be less effective.\nSupport staff would constantly have to bear in mind the two sides to their roles,\nprogramme and project. It would be easier to miss a programme implication of a\nchange or risk because of focusing on doing the job at project level.\n5 Planning\nOrganisation\nPlanning\nControls\nStages\nManagement of Risk\nQuality in a project\nConfiguration\nManagement\nChange Control\nDirecting a Project\nStarting\nUp a\nProject\nInitiating\na\nProject\nCompleting\n& Starting\nStages\nControlling\na Stage\nManaging\nProduct\nDelivery\nClosing\na Project\nenvironment\nFigure 14: Planning in the PRINCE Template\n5.1 What is a plan?\nA plan is a document, framed in accordance with a pre-defined scheme or method,\ndescribing how, when and by whom a specific target or set of targets is to be\nachieved. A plan is a design of how identified targets for deliverables, timescales,\ncosts and quality can be met.\nPlans are the backbone of the management information system required for any\nproject.\nA plan requires the approval and commitment of the Project Management Team and\nmust be formally approved by the Project Board.\n5.2 What are the components of a plan?\nA plan is a statement of:\n* the products to be produced\n* the activities needed to create those deliverables\n* the activities needed to validate the quality of deliverables\n* the resources and time needed for all activities (including quality control),\n  and any need for people with specific skills\n* the dependencies between activities\n* external dependencies for the delivery of information, products or services\n* when activities will occur\n",
    "47": "* the points at which progress will be monitored and controlled\n* what risks there are which may prevent the plan being achieved and what\n  measures should be taken to address these risks.\nPlans should be presented as management reports, with key information\ndocumented in a way that the audience can understand, interpret and question. A\nStage Plan might, therefore, be held in two forms; a summary plan suitable for\npresentation to the Project Board, and the more detailed one used for day-to-day\ncontrol of the stage.\nThe statement of activities and breakdown of resource requirements must be backed\nup by text which explains to the reader:\n* what the plan covers (e.g. delivery of specific products)\n* the intended approach to implement the plan\n* how adherence to it is to be monitored and controlled\n* what management reports will be issued\n* the quality control methods and resources to be used\n* any assumptions on which the plan is based\n* any pre-requisites which must be in place on day one of the plan\n* an assessment of the risks which could affect the plan and how these are to\n  be controlled.\nFigure 15: The Components of a Plan\nQuality\nRisks\nResources\nPre-Requisites\nActivities\nProducts\nAssumptions\nDependencies\nControls\nCost &\nTime\nFigure 15 shows the components of a plan and illustrates how it might be built up,\nstarting from a list of the products to be produced. Any pre-requisites are\nidentified, together with the quality requirements of the products. These three\ncomponents lead to consideration of what assumptions are being made or are to be\nmade. The next consideration is to define the activities required to generate the\nproducts. Resources to carry out the activities are added. Then the dependencies\nbetween the activities are identified. Risks are then considered, followed by the\naddition of control points. The last two steps might add to the activities and\nresources required. Finally the overall time and cost are calculated.\n5.3   The PRINCE approach\n",
    "48": "The PRINCE planning structure allows for a plan to be broken down into lower\nlevel plans containing more detail. But all plans have the same overall structure and\nare always matched back to the planned requirements, including quality and\nbenefits, before approval.\n5.4 Levels of plan\nActivity duration’s and resource requirements become more difficult to estimate\naccurately the further into the future they extend. Regardless of this problem, there\nis still a need to provide a provisional estimate of the duration and cost of the\nproject as a whole in order to gain approval to proceed.\nIt is seldom desirable, or possible, to plan an entire project in detail at the start. The\nreasons for this include:\n* uncertainty about the detailed nature of later elements of work\n* a changing or uncertain environment\n* risk factors which could change the situation\n* difficulty in predicting resource availability well into the future\n* difficulty in predicting business conditions in the future.\nHowever, if the current elements of work are to be controlled, detailed plans\ncontaining firm estimates are needed for the realistically foreseeable future. For\nthese reasons, plans need to be produced at different levels of scope and detail.\nProject\nPlan\nStage\nPlan\nTeam\nPlan\nException\nPlan\nFigure 16: PRINCE Plan Levels\nPRINCE proposes two basic levels of planning, the Project Plan and the Stage Plan,\nto reflect the needs of the different levels of management involved in the project.\nUse of the Team Plans illustrated in Figure 16 is optional, and will depend on the\nneeds of the individual project. These other levels are explained in more detail later\nin this chapter, but, briefly:\n* a Stage Plan may be broken down into a number of Team Plans (where, for\n  example, a number of teams may be contributing to the work)\n* where a Stage or Project Plan is forecast to exceed its tolerances, an\n  Exception Plan is put forward which will replace a Stage Plan or lead to a\n  revised Project Plan.\n",
    "49": "The principal idea behind the levels is that the lower the level, the shorter the plan’s\ntimeframe and the more detail it contains. The project chooses the levels and,\ntherefore, the number of plans it needs according to its size and extent of risk\nexposure.\n5.4.1   Project Plan\nAn overview of the total project is needed.  This is the Project Plan. It forms part of\nthe Project Initiation Document. The Project Plan is mandatory. It provides the\nBusiness Case with project costs and is used by the Project Board as a baseline\nagainst which to monitor actual costs and project progress stage by stage. The\nProject Plan identifies key deliverables, resource requirements and the total costs. It\nalso identifies major control points within the project, such as stage boundaries. The\nProject Quality Plan for the project is documented separately in another part of the\nProject Initiation Document.\nOnce the Project Initiation Document has been accepted, the initial Project Plan is\n‘baselined’ and shows the original plan on which the project was approved.\nSubsequent versions of the Project Plan are produced at the end of each stage to\nreflect:\n* progress already made\n* any agreed changes in circumstances\n* many revised forecast of cost and/or duration of the total project\nas the project moves through its stages. The initial and current versions of the\nProject Plan form part of the information used by the Project Board to monitor how\nfar the project is deviating from its original size and scope.\nIf the Project Plan is likely to exceed the tolerance laid down by corporate or\nprogramme management, the deviation must be referred upwards by the Project\nBoard to get a decision on corrective action. In such cases an Exception Plan (for the\nentire project) should accompany the submission. The format of an Exception Plan\nis described later in the chapter.\n5.4.2    Stage Plan\nFor each stage identified in the Project Plan, a Stage Plan is required. Each Stage\nPlan is produced near the end of the previous stage. It will be the basis of the\nProject Manager’s day-to-day control.\nIt is frequently the case that much of the work in a stage will be done by specialist\nteams or Suppliers who will have their own plans for the work they are doing.\nThese plans will not necessarily integrate comfortably with the stage concepts\nexplained elsewhere. This means that the Project Manager will need to construct the\nStage Plan from the various specialist development plans to establish overall\nresource and timing elements and interdependencies for the work through to the\nnext assessment by the Project Board.\nThe Stage Plan is similar to the Project Plan in content, but each element will be\nbroken down to the level of detail required to be an adequate basis for day-to-day\ncontrol by the Project Manager. The validity of assumptions and risk analyses\nshould be re-assessed for the stage, as these may have changed since they were\npreviously considered, new risks may have arisen or become apparent when\nlooking in more detail.\nStage Plans and Team Plans should contain a Quality Plan which will identify the\n",
    "50": "method(s) to be used to check the quality of each product and the resources to be\nused for the checks. For example, for any Quality Reviews the names of the\nChairman and reviewers would be given. The timing and resource effort will be\nshown in the graphic plan (typically a Gantt Chart).\nEach Stage Plan is finalised near the end of the previous stage. This approach\nshould give more confidence in the plan because:\n* the Stage Plan is produced close to the time when the planned events will take\n  place\n* the Stage Plan is for a much shorter duration than the Project Plan\n* after the first stage the Stage Plan is developed with knowledge of the\n  performance of earlier stages.\n5.4.3   Exception Plan\nWhen it is predicted that a plan will no longer finish within the agreed tolerances,\nan Exception Plan is produced to replace that plan. An Exception Plan is prepared\nat the same level of detail as the plan it replaces. Most Exception Plans will be\ncreated to replace a Stage Plan, but the Project Plan may also need to be replaced.\nAn Exception Plan picks up from the current Stage Plan actuals and continues to the\nend of the Stage.\nAn Exception Plan has the same format as the plan which it will replace, but the\ntext will cover:\n* what has caused the deviation\n* what is anticipated if no action is taken\n* the options open\n* the Project Manager’s recommendation\n* the impact of the Exception Plan on the Project Plan (if it is a lower level of\n  plan which is being replaced), the Business Case and risks.\nThis extra information comes from the Exception Report. The Exception Plan needs\nthe approval of the Project Board.\n5.4.4   Team Plan\nTeam plans are optional and are used to break down activities into a lower level of\ntasks which are to produce one or more of the Stage Plan’s products. They might be\nused for separate teams working in a stage, especially if those teams are from\ndifferent skill groups, or work for single contractors. The Team Manager would use\nthe Team Plan. The Stage Plan would be a summary of the various Team Plans.\nThe need for Team Plans will be determined by the size and complexity of the\nproject and the number of people involved. If they are considered necessary, the\nplans are prepared in parallel with the Stage Plan.\n5.5    Benefits of planning\nEffective planning identifies:\n* whether the targets are achievable\n* the resources needed to achieve the targets within a timeframe\n* the activities needed to ensure that quality can be built into the products\n* the problems and risks associated with trying to achieve the targets and stay\n  within the constraints.\n",
    "51": "Other benefits of planning include:\n* avoiding muddle and ad hoc decisions\n* helping the management team to think ahead\n* providing a yardstick against which progress can be measured\n* communication, through the distribution of a plan to all concerned, of what\n  is to be done, how it is to be done, the allocation of responsibilities and how\n  progress will be monitored and controlled\n* gaining commitment from the contributors and recipients\n* the provision of personal targets.\nPlanning is not a trivial exercise. It is vital to the success of the project. A plan must\ncontain sufficient information and detail to confirm that the targets of the plan are\nachievable.\nIt is essential to allocate time for the planning activity. Every project should have an\nInitiation Stage in which time is allocated to identify and agree the scope of the\nproject and to plan it in terms of management, resourcing, deliverables, activities,\nquality and control. Time should also be allocated for the refinement of the Business\nCase. The Initiation Stage may or may not be formal, depending on the nature and\ncomplexity of the project. In addition, during the Initiation Stage and towards the\nend of every stage in the project except the last one, time should be allowed for\nplanning the next stage in detail.\nWithout effective planning, the outcome of complex projects cannot be predicted in\nterms of scope, quality, risk, timescale and cost. Those involved in providing\nresources cannot optimise their operations. Poorly planned projects cause\nfrustration, waste and re-work.\nHints and tips for planning\nWhen planning, it is easily to forget to add the resources needed to do impact\nassessment on change requests. Even if a change is subsequently rejected, the\nassessment will still consume time and effort, probably from the senior team\nmembers.\nIt is important to identify for which products the Customer and Supplier are\nresponsible. An extra heading curl be added to the Product Description to record\nthis information.\nPlans need to be at an appropriate level to facilitate controls.

    "53": "Plan\nMonitor\nControl\nFigure 18: The control loop\n6.2    Controls Overview\nThere are various levels of control in the project. Most controls in PRINCE are\nevent-driven, including all the decision-making ones. There are some time-driven\ncontrols such as regular progress feedback. At the project level there is overall\ncontrol by the Project Board, which receives information from the Project Manager\n(and any assurance roles appointed) and has control over whether the project\ncontinues, stops or changes direction or scope.\nPRINCE applies the concept of ‘management by exception’ where the Project Board\nis concerned. That is, having approved a Stage Plan, the Project Board is kept\ninformed by reports during the stage. There is no need for ‘progress meetings’\nduring the stage. The Project Board knows that the Project Manager will inform\nthem immediately if any exception situation is forecast.\nThe major controls for the Project Board are:\n* Project Initiation (Should the project be undertaken?)\n* End Stage Assessment (Has the stage been successful? Is the project still on\n  course? Is the Business Case still viable? Are the risks still under control?\n  Should the next stage be undertaken?)\n* Highlight Reports (Regular progress reports during a stage)\n* Exception Reports (Early warning of any forecast deviation beyond\n  tolerance levels)\n* Mid Stage Assessment (The Project Board jointly consider what action to\n  take in response to a forecast deviation)\n* Project Closure (Has the project delivered everything expected? Are any\n  follow-on actions necessary? What lessons have been learned?).\nThe Project Board must also monitor the environment outside the project and bring\nto the notice of those concerned, such as the Project Manager, any changes which\naffect the project.\nThe Project Manager has control on a day-to-day basis within a stage and can make\nadjustments as long as the stage and project stay within the tolerances defined by\nthe Project Board and the adjustments do not change the Business Case. The Project\nManager is responsible for monitoring progress, and may be assisted by project\n",

The individuals or teams monitor\nprogress through the Work Package and report back to the Project Manager via\nCheckpoints or other identified means (such as risk ‘triggers’).\nPRINCE is designed for a variety of Customer/Supplier situations. For clarity, the\nPRINCE manual has been written on the assumption that the project will be run for\na Customer with a single (prime) Supplier involved throughout. This has a bearing\non not only the organisation of the project, but also the controls.\nPlanned achievement includes the required quality of products. The aim is to detect\nproblems early while they can be corrected at least cost. Action should be taken in\nrespect of any deviation from plan which is forecast to be outside tolerance.\nThe what, why, who, how and when questions must be answered satisfactorily\nbefore the project proceeds beyond Initiation.\nProgress is monitored against plans, with control actions if adjustments are needed.\nThe Project Management Team are kept informed at their various levels by reports\nand assessments.\nThere is a controlled close to ensure that the project does not drift on for ever, but\ndoes not finish until the Project Manager can satisfy the Project Board that the\nobjectives specified in the Project Initiation Document have been achieved,\n6.3    Controlled Start\n6.3.1 Project Start-up\nProject Start-up is an important pre-requisite of project control. Project Start-up\ncontains the work which PRINCE requires is done before the project can begin. Its\nfunctions are to:\n* set up the organisation so that the Project Board and Project Manager can\n  make the necessary initial decisions about the project\n* plan the Initiation Stage\n* develop what may be a rudimentary Project Mandate into the Project Brief.\nPRINCE takes the Project Initiation Meeting to be the official ‘start’ of the project,\nThe Project Board approves the plan for the Initiation Stage at this Project Initiation\nMeeting,\nProject Initiation is likely to be a short stage in comparison with the other project\nstages, but the approval of the Project Board is needed before it can be done. Project\nStart-up must, therefore, create a plan for the Initiation Stage which the Project\nBoard can examine in order to understand the required commitment more clearly.\nThe plan should include a statement of any controls and reports which the Project\nBoard is to receive, so that the Project Board is assured in advance that the stage\nwill be under its control.\nAs the creation of the Project Mandate is out of the control of the project, it often\nfalls short of providing all the information which the project needs. Start-up gives\nthe Project Manager the opportunity to flesh it out into a full Project Brief and thus\npresent the objectives of the project to the Project Board at the Project Initiation\nMeeting for its agreement.  Where the project is part of a programme, the\nprogramme should provide a complete Project Brief, thus removing the need to\nproduce it during Start-up.\n",
    "55": "6.3.2    Project Initiation\nThe purpose of Project Initiation is to ensure that before significant resource is spent\non the project, everything involved in the project is agreed on:\n* the project objectives\n* the reasons (Business Case)\n* who the Customer is\n* who has which responsibilities and authority\n* project boundaries and interfaces to the outside world\n* how the objectives will be met\n* what assumptions have been or can be made\n* what major risks exist which might prevent the project from achieving its\n  objectives\n* when the major products will be delivered\n* how much the project will cost\n* how the project will be controlled\n* the division of the project into stages\n* how the acceptability of its products will be assessed.\nThese questions are answered in the Project Initiation Document, which is the main\nproduct from the stage. A suggested outline of the contents of the Project Initiation\nDocument is included in Appendix A – PRINCE Product outlines.\nThe establishment of a suitable Project Management Team is discussed in the\nOrganisation chapter.\nAnother product of the Initiation Stage is the next Stage Plan, so that if the Project\nBoard is satisfied with the Project Initiation Document, it can also approve progress\ninto the next stage without further delay.\nOnce approved at the end of the Project Initiation Stage, the Project Initiation\nDocument is ‘frozen’. It is now a reference document to show the original basis of\nthe project. At the end of the project it can be measured against final expectations\nand results to assess the success of the project and to check, for example, that any\nchanges to the Project Plan were made in a controlled manner. It is an essential part\nof the audit trail on how the project has been managed.\nBut changes do occur, and it would be wrong not to record the impact of those\nchanges and keep the Project Management Team ‘up to date’, so further versions of\nthe most volatile parts of the Project Initiation Document are created as changes\noccur. Again, this forms part of the audit trail, showing any moves away from the\ninformation in the Project Initiation Document, when and why this happened, what\nthe impact of the change was.  The most volatile parts of the Project Initiation\nDocument are:\n* Project Plan\n* Business Case\n* Risk Log.\nAs later versions of these are created, they are kept in the management section of\nthe project filing. A suitable structure for the filing is illustrated in the Project filing\nchapter in the Techniques section of the manual.\nThese volatile parts will be updated throughout the project, at least at the end of\neach stage.\nTo summarise, the main purpose of the Project Initiation Document is to pull the\ninformation together to answer the questions ‘What?’, ‘Why?’, ‘Who?’, ‘When?’ and\n‘How?’,\n",
    "56": "6.3.3    Stage selection\nAccording to its size and riskiness, the Project Board decides to break the project\ninto a number of stages. This is agreed during the Initiation Stage. The breakdown\nof the project into stages is discussed in the Stages chapter.\nThe end of each stage is a major control point for the Project Board (see End Stage\nAssessment), thus the selection of the number of stages and their timing in the\nproject life cycle is an important control for the Project Board.\nHints and tips for Project Initiation\nUnder the ‘Project Controls’ section of the Project Initiation Document it is useful\nto mention the development of the Lessons Learned Report (see later in this chapter).\nThis alerts readers to the fact that it should be a document on-going throughout\nthe life of the project. Otherwise it may be left until Project Closure, when memories\nof some lessons may have faded.\n6.4    Controlled progress\nDuring the project there is a need to ensure that the project stays in line with the\nexpectations defined in the Project Initiation Document and the current Stage Plan.\n6.4.1   Tolerance\nNo project ever goes 100% to plan. Even with a good plan, some things will go a\nlittle slower than planned, or cost a little more; other things will go more quickly,\ncost a little less. Such variations will occur all the way through a plan. Although the\nProject Board agreed a plan with the Project Manager, it doesn’t want the Project\nManager to be constantly running back to it, saying ‘I’ve spent a pound more than I\nplanned this week’ or ‘I’m a day late this week’. On the other hand, the Project\nBoard doesn’t want progress to deviate wildly from the plan without being told and\nbeing able to react. So where is the dividing line between differences which are\npermissible and those which require Project Board intervention? The dividing line is\ncalled Tolerance.\nThe two standard elements to tolerance are:\n* time\n* cost.\nTolerance is the permissible deviation from a Stage or Project Plan without bringing\nthe deviation to the attention of the Project Board (or higher authority if the\ndeviation is at project level). Separate tolerance figures should be given for time\nand cost.\nTolerances for the project as a whole should be set by corporate or programme\nmanagement in the Project Mandate (or ascertained by the Executive during Start-up,\nto be entered into the Project Brief). Based on these overall figures the Project\nBoard agrees with the Project Manager a tolerance for each stage, once the Stage\nPlan has been produced.\nIf the tolerance for a stage is forecast to be exceeded, the Project Board may set new\ntolerances around the new forecast as long as these are within the constraints of the\noverall project figures. Where the forecast is for the project tolerance to be\nexceeded, the Project Board must refer the matter back to corporate or programme\nmanagement for a decision.\n",
    "57": "£\nTime\nA\nB\nC\nD\na\nc\nb\nd\nFigure 19: Cost, Time Tolerance Graph\nFigure 19 illustrates cost and time tolerances and the Project Manager’s freedom of\ndecision within the tolerances. Line A is the plan. Lines B and C show the limits of\nthe tolerance in cost and time given by the Project Board. Line B illustrates that the\nplan may cost a little more than forecast or take a little longer. Line C illustrates that\nthe plan may cost a little less, or take a shorter time. Within these two limits the\nplan is judged to be under control. Line D illustrates how actual progress might be\nproceeding. Although it is deviating from the plan, it is within the tolerance\nmargins. If at any time the Project Manager can forecast that line D will break\nthrough either of the tolerance lines a special procedure is invoked (see the\nException Report and Exception Plan later in this chapter) which brings in the\nProject Board to ‘manage by exception’. The four corners of the box indicate the\ntolerance limits on cost and time for the total plan, e.g. the bottom left-hand corner\nof the box (c) indicates the shortest time and least cost of the plan within the\ntolerance limits. The top right-hand corner (d) represents the tolerance limits for\nexceeding the planned cost and time.\n",
    "58": "Hints and tips for Tolerance\nIn most projects funding is provided by the Customer. But there are situations\nwhere the Supplier or third party either fully or partially funds the project. This\nmay give the Customer fewer rights to intervene or control the project’s expenditure.\nIn such situations it is important for the Customer and User to consider and\nestablish controls giving them involvement in quality inspection and approval to\nproceed at stage ends. There must also be sufficient progress reporting to assure\nthe Project Board that the project is under control. A tolerance margin for time\nshould still be set.\nThere are actually four possible elements to tolerance; cost, time, scope and quality.\nWhere there is a tight or non-existent positive tolerance, e.g. the end product must\nbe delivered by date X, the Project Manager would normally look for extra tolerance\nin one or more of the other elements, such as cost (e.g. Can more resources or overtime\nbe used to ensure that the time tolerance is not to be exceeded?). Where there is\nlittle or no tolerance on time, cost and scope, the Project Manager must watch out\nfor the temptation for individuals or teams to reduce the quality of work unofficially\nas a means of saving time.\nThe Project Board should think, stage by stage (and the figures may change for\neach stage), ‘Under what circumstances do we want to take this stage back from\nthe Project Manager? Under what circumstances are we happy to let the Project\nManager run with it ?‘\n6.4.2    Product Descriptions\nA description of each product is written down before that product is developed/\nobtained, even before it is planned, to ensure that the individual people know:\n* why it is needed\n* what it will look like\n* from what sources it will be derived\n* the quality specification to which it must be built.\nThe Product Description is a control document. It is written as part of the planning\nprocess. A Product Description defines such elements as the content of a product to\nbe delivered by the project, standards to be used in its creation, and the quality\ncriteria to be applied. Not only is this information essential for the creator, but the\nProduct Description also forms the initial checklist for checking the quality of the\nfinished product.\nWhen a product has been identified in a plan’s Product Breakdown Structure, its\nProduct Description should be drafted. An outline of the information which should\nbe given in a Product Description is provided in Appendix A – PRINCE Product\noutlines, together with outline Product Descriptions of standard PRINCE\nmanagement and quality products (such as plans, reports, approvals).\nAll Product Descriptions must be approved. In formal terms they are approved by\nthe Project Board. If the assurance roles of the Project Board members are\ndelegated, the assurance of the Product Descriptions may be one of the authorities\nto be delegated.\nThe relevant Product Description forms part of a Work Package Authorisation given\nto an individual or team responsible for creation of that product.\n",
    "59": "Hints and tips for Product Descriptions\nProduct Descriptions should be written by staff who know the proposed product.\nProduct Descriptions may not be needed for every level of product. The Project\nBoard can make a decision as to which are the major products for which a Product\nDescription is necessary.\n6.4.3 Work Package Authorisation\nWork Package Authorisation is the trigger from the Project Manager to an\nindividual or group to undertake a piece of the work of a stage. The implication is\nthat work cannot be undertaken unless the Project Manager has specifically\nauthorised it.\nWork is released to a team member or Team Manager in an agreed Work Package. The\nWork Package will contain the Product Description, constraints such as time, cost\nand interfaces, reporting and product hand-over requirements and any other\ndocumentation or products necessary for understanding and implementing the\nWork Package. Work Package Authorisation is particularly useful when dealing\nwith contractors or sub-contractors. The two sides to it (giver and receiver) are\ndescribed in Authorising Work Package (CSI) and Accepting a Work Package (MPI).\n6.4.4    Quality Control\nEvery project needs procedures and techniques to control the quality of the\nproducts being produced. The ideal quality controls will vary according to the type\nof product and project, and PRINCE makes no effort to define all the possibilities. It\ndoes include a generic quality check which has been found to be effective over a\nnumber of years in checking the quality of documents. The check is called a Quality\nReview.\nThe Quality Review is one type of quality check. It is a team method of assuring\nproduct quality by a review process. The purpose of the review is to inspect the\nproduct for errors in a planned, independent, controlled and documented manner.\nQuality Review documentation, when filed in the Quality section of the project\nfiling, provides a record that the product was inspected, that any errors found were\ncorrected and the corrections themselves checked. Knowing that a product has been\nchecked and declared error-free provides a more confident basis to move ahead and\nuse that product as the basis of future work.\nA Quality Review can be used to control the quality of documents, including those\ncreated by the specialists. A Quality Review provides a feedback to the Project\nManager on the status of a document (and the performance of the Quality Review\ntechnique). It is fully described in its own chapter.\nThere are many other types of quality check, depending on the type of product to be\ntested. PRINCE is compatible with all types of check.\n",
    "60": "6.4.5     Project Issues\nAs part of control there must be a procedure which caters for possible deviations\nfrom specification. These deviations occur for many reasons:\n* the User’s requirement changes\n* government legislation changes and the product’s specification must be\n  revised to accommodate these changes\n* the User or Supplier wants to change or add an acceptance criterion\n* during the development extra features suggest themselves for inclusion\n* there are organisational or business changes which alter the scope and\n  objectives of the project\n* the Supplier finds that it will be impossible to deliver everything within the\n  agreed cost or schedule\n* a question arises on whether the Supplier can meet a particular part of the\n  specification or acceptance criterion\n* a sub-contractor or interfacing project {ails to meet its planned commitment.\nApart from deviation possibilities, there will also be a need for an avenue into the\nproject for questions or concerns. All of these need a procedure to control them and\ntheir effect on the project. In PRINCE all such inputs are handled by the Project\nIssue procedure.\nThis procedure ensures that all such questions, problems, concerns or suggestions\nare answered, but that nothing is undertaken without the knowledge of the\nappropriate level of management, including the Project Board. Apart from\ncontrolling possible changes, it provides a formal entry point through which all\nquestions or requests can be raised.\nThe Project Issue procedure logs and handles all Project Issues raised during the life\nof the project. The procedure provides knowledge of the status of all Project Issues,\ncontrol over their processing and a feedback to the originator on any actions taken.\n6.4.6    Change Control\nEvery project must have a procedure to handle change. Without change control\nthere is no project control.\nAll requested changes are logged as Project Issues. The procedure includes impact\nassessment of the request, prioritisation, decision-making and action. There is a\nseparate chapter describing the control of change and another chapter on a\nsuggested change control procedure in the Techniques section of the manual.\n6.4.7 Risk Log\nThe management of risk is an important control throughout the project.\nA log is kept of all identified risks, their analysis, countermeasures and status. This\nbegins at the start of the project and continues until the project closes. All risks are\nfrequently reviewed. As a minimum risks are re-assessed at the end of each stage,\nbut they should also be reviewed as part of the assessment of stage progress.\nThere is a separate chapter on the management of risk.\n",
    "61": "6.4.8 Checkpoint\nA Checkpoint is a time-driven control when the status of work in a stage or of a\nteam is ascertained. It involves the people carrying out the work and is triggered by\neither the Project Manager or the Team Manager, whoever is the more appropriate. In\nlarger projects the participants might be the Project Manager, Team Managers and\nproject support people. It may or may not be a formal meeting.\nA specific aim of a Checkpoint is to check all aspects of the project against the plans\nto ensure that there are no nasty surprises hiding. Useful questions are ‘What is not\ngoing to plan?’ and ‘What is likely not to go to plan?’\nThe information gathered at a Checkpoint is recorded for the Project Manager and\nforms the basis of the Highlight Report. Checkpoints should be taken as frequently\nas the Project Manager requires in order to maintain control over progress. They\nmay coincide with the Project Manager’s need to consider re-planning.\nA Checkpoint can also be used for the downward dissemination of information\nfrom the Project Board, corporate or programme management to team members.\nThe suggested content of a Checkpoint Report is given in Appendix A - PRINCE\nProduct outlines.\n6.4.9    Planning and re-planning\nPlans are, to a certain extent, guesswork. Activities do not always go as planned.\nResources do not always perform as expected. Unplanned activities may emerge.\nThe Project Manager needs to compare the plan regularly against latest information\nand be ready to re-plan. Failure to re-plan, or re-planning too seldom, can leave it\ntoo late to recover from problems. There is, however, a danger of reacting too early\nor too frequently to the status of non-critical activities. Small deviations may correct\nthemselves and the Project Manager may spend too much time in re-planning rather\nthan in monitoring. When and how often to re-plan will depend on the size and\ncriticality of the project, and is a matter for the Project Manager’s judgement.\nRe-planning is needed at stage boundaries and when Exceptions arise.\n6.4.10    Highlight Report\nA Highlight Report is sent by the Project Manager to the Project Board during a\nstage at a frequency dictated by the Project Board. The frequency depends on such\nfactors as the length and perceived risk of the stage. Typically the report might be\nsent fortnightly or monthly.\nThe Project Board has the right to define the content of the Highlight Report.\nMinimally it should contain statements about:\n* achievements in the current period\n* achievements expected in the next period\n* actual or potential problems and suggestions concerning their resolution.\nThe Project Board may also ask for a copy of the Stage Plan (or parts of it), showing\nactual progress to date in terms of activities and cost, plus reports on any other\nitem in the stage which it feels is important. Whatever the content, the style should\nbe concise. Instead of a copy of the Stage Plan the Project Board may prefer to\nreceive an updated copy of the Product Checklist, showing status and any revised\ndates.\nOften the frequency of Highlight Reports is defined for the whole project in the\nProject Initiation Document, but the frequency can be varied for different stages.\nFor example, the Initiation Stage is normally very short, and the Project Board may\nrequest either no Highlight Reports or a lower frequency.\n",
    "62": "A Highlight Report’s purpose is to allow the Project Board to ‘manage by exception’\nbetween End Stage Assessments. The Project Board is aware of the Stage Plan to\nwhich it is committed, and of the tolerance margins which it agreed with the Project\nManager, The Highlight Reports confirm that progress is being made within those\ntolerances. Early warning of any possible problems is reported to the Project Board\nvia the Highlight Report. The Project Board can react to any problems which are\nreported, as formally or informally as it feels is necessary.\nThe Project Board can request that copies of the Highlight Report are sent to other\ninterested parties.\nAppendix A – PRINCE Product outlines contains a suggested outline for a Highlight\nReport.\nHints and tips for the Highlight Report\nThe Project Manager can use the Highlight Report to convey concern about items\nwhich are under the control of any member of the Project Board. As the report is\nread by all members of the Project Board, any member whose commitment is the\nsource of the concern will feel pressure from the other members to put the matter\nright.\nThe Senior User has part of the responsibility for monitoring project deliverables.\nThis may be difficult to do where a remote Supplier or third party is developing or\nprocuring the product. Monitoring can be assisted by Checkpoint and Highlight\nReports and by User involvement in checking the quality of such products.\n6.4.11     Exception Report\nAn Exception Report is a warning from the Project Manager to the Project Board\nthat the Stage (or Project) Plan will deviate outside its tolerance margins. It is a wise\nprecaution for the Project Manager to document the report.\nThere are situations where it is the tolerance for the whole project which is at risk,\nand not just that for the stage. For example, information may be found which shows\nthat a major equipment expenditure, which is to be made much later in the project,\nwill greatly exceed current expectations and take the project outside tolerance.\nAn Exception Report describes a forecast deviation, provides an analysis of both the\nexception and the options for the way forward, and identifies the recommended\noption. There is a suggested content for the Exception Report in Appendix A –\nPRINCE Product outlines. An Exception Report usually leads to a meeting (Mid Stage\nAssessment), and will be the basis for the production of an Exception Plan for the\nrecommended option.\nWhere the project is part of a programme, exception situations may occur because\nof changes or problems at the project or programme level. Examples would be a\nbusiness change or the late delivery of an externally purchased product which may\nimpact the whole programme or just a single project. Changes in end dates or to the\nspecification of products to be delivered by the project are likely to have a knock-on\neffect in the programme. To avoid duplication of effort and to save time, those\nexception situations likely to impact more than a single project within a programme\nshould be co-ordinated at programme level.\n6.4.12 End Stage Assessment\nPart of the philosophy of breaking the project into stages is that the Project Board\nonly commits to one stage at a time. At the end of that stage the Project Board takes\na good look at the project to decide if it wishes to proceed to the next stage. This\nreview is called an End Stage Assessment. According to such factors as project size,\ncriticality and risk situation, the End Stage Assessment may be formal or informal.\n",
    "63": "However it is done, the End Stage Assessment is a mandatory control point at the\nend of each stage. The assessment approves the work to date and provides\nauthority to proceed to the next stage. A stage should not be considered complete\nuntil it has received this formal approval.\nAn End Stage Assessment has the specific objectives to:\n* check that the need for the project has not changed\n* review the results of the stage against the Stage Plans\n* satisfy the Project Board about the quality of the products delivered\n* establish that the current stage has been completed satisfactorily\n* check if any external event has changed the project’s premises\n* perform a risk analysis and management review of the project and the next\n  Stage Plan and incorporate the results into the next Stage Plan and Project\n  Plan\n* review overall project status against the Project Plans (which may now have\n  been revised)\n* review the next Stage Plan against the Project Plans\n* ensure that a complete and consistent baseline is established for the next\n  stage\n* review the tolerances set for the next stage\n* ensure that the specialist aspects of the project are still sound\n* review the project against its Business Case and ensure that the project is\n  still viable\n* authorise the passage of the project into the next stage (if the Business Case\n  continues to be viable),\nThe Project Board has the right to refuse to approve the next Stage Plan if it is\nunhappy with any of the aspects mentioned in the list above. It can either ask the\nProject Manager to re-think the next Stage Plan, force closure of the project, or refer\nthe problem to corporate or programme management if the problem is beyond its\nremit.\n6.4.13 End Stage. Report\nThe End Stage Report is the vehicle through which the Project Manager informs the\nProject Board of the results of a stage. The Project Board can compare the results in\nterms of products, cost and time against the Stage Plan which it approved.\nThe End Stage Report contains all the information described for an End Stage\nAssessment, except the approval to proceed to the next stage. It forms a record\nwhich can be audited at any time in the project, giving a summary of what\nhappened in a stage, the impact on the Project Plan, Business Case and risks, and\nwhy decisions about the future of the project were made.\n",
    "64": "6.4.14 Mid Stage Assessment\nA Mid Stage Assessment is held between the Project Board and Project Manager\nafter an Exception Report. If any of the Project Board’s assurance responsibilities\nhave been delegated, the people to whom assurance has been delegated would also\nparticipate. Its purpose is for the Project Manager to present an Exception Plan to\nthe Project Board and obtain its approval for implementation of the plan. As with\nthe End Stage Assessment, it may be formal or informal according to the size,\ncriticality and risk of the project.\nThe content of an Exception Plan is the same as that of other PRINCE plans. There\nis some additional text which is described in the Planning chapter.\nEvery exception has an impact on the stage, project, Business Case and risks. The\nrecommended option will also have an impact on the same items. The Project Board\nmust consider both sets of impact.\n6.5    Controlled Close\nBefore the Project Board allows the project to close (unless the project has been\nprematurely terminated), it has the control to ensure that:\n* all the agreed products have been delivered and accepted\n* arrangements are in place, where appropriate, to support and maintain the\n  product in its useful life\n* any useful statistics or lessons for later projects are passed to the relevant\n  body\n* a plan has been made to check the achievement of the benefits claimed in the\n  project’s Business Case.\nAt Project Closure the Project Board must confirm in writing (for the project\nmanagement file) its acceptance that the project has been completed. If necessary,\nthese statements can be qualified, e.g. that the products have been delivered with\nminor deficiencies which can be rectified later.\nThe following information is generated at the close of the project which leads to\ncontrol actions by the Project Board.\n6.5.1 End Project Notification\nThe End Project Notification advises all those who have provided resources or\nservices to the project that the project is coming to an end.\n6.5.2 Lessons Learned Report\nThe Lessons Learned Report is created within the project to disseminate useful\nlessons learned during the project for the benefit of other projects.\nIt covers management, specialist and quality processes, techniques and tools, what\nworked well and what caused problems. It is a useful control as part of the\nfunctions of an independent quality assurance or similar group. A suggested\ncontent is included in Appendix A – PRINCE Product outlines.\nThe Lessons Learned Report is gradually built up (and acted on) during the project\nand handed over as one of the products at Project Closure.\n",
    "65": "6.5.3 Follow-on Action recommendations\nAt the close of the project there may be a number of actions left undone. For\nexample, there may have been a number of Requests For Change which the Project\nBoard decided not to implement during the project, but which were not rejected;\nnot all expected products may have been handed over, or there may be some known\nproblems with what has been delivered.\nThe Follow-on Action recommendations document any unfinished business and\nallow the Project Board to direct them to the person or group whose job it will be to\nhave the recommendations considered for action after the current project has\nended.\n6.5.4 End Project Report\nThe End Project Report is similar to the End Stage Report, but covers the entire\nproject. A suggested content is included in Appendix A – PRINCE Product outlines.\nThe End Project Report reviews actual achievements against the Project Initiation\nDocument. Where possible the achievement by the project of the benefits\nanticipated in the Business Case is reviewed. Any changes which were made after\nthe Project Initiation Document was agreed are identified, and their impact on\nProject Plan, Business Case and risks is assessed.\nThe report provides statistics on Project Issues and their impact on the project, plus\nstatistics on the quality of work carried out.\n6.5.5 Post Implementation Review\nThe Post Implementation Review occurs outside the project.\nNormally many products need time in use before the achievement of their expected\nbenefits can be measured. This measurement after a period of use is an activity\ncalled a Post Implementation Review. At Project Closure a plan is agreed on when\nand how achievement of benefits can be measured.\nA Post Implementation Review occurs after the project has closed.

A stage is a collection of\nactivities and products whose delivery is managed as a unit. As such it is a sub-set\nof the project, and in PRINCE terms it is the element of work which the Project\nManager is managing on behalf of the Project Board at any one time. The use of\nstages in a PRINCE project is mandatory; the number of stages is flexible and\ndepends on the needs of the project.\nPRINCE stages are often described as ‘management stages’ in order to differentiate\nthem from a different use of the word ‘stages’ in some specific project\nenvironments. This is described below.\n7.1.1 Phases and Stages\nIn some methods the word ‘phase’ is used as an equivalent to the PRINCE stage.\nThis is not in itself a problem.\nIt would become a problem if people thought of product life cycle phases, such as:\n* conception\n* feasibility\n* implementation (or realisation)\n* operation\n* termination\n",
    "67": "as PRINCE stages. These are phases for the product life cycle, not the project. The\nlast two are outside the project. While a product is ‘operational’ it may be the\nsubject of any number of projects to enhance or revise it. Most of what in PRINCE\nterms will be stages will be divisions of ‘implementation’ in the product life cycle.\n7.2     Why are Management Stages important?\nThere are various reasons for breaking the project into stages. They include the\nfollowing.\n7.2.1 Review and decision points\nWithin any project there will be key decisions, the results of which will have\nfundamental effects on the direction and detailed content of the project. There\nthus, a need to review direction and on-going viability on a regular basis.\nPRINCE uses stages to deal with these decision points. The decisions form the basis\nof the End Stage Assessments carried out in Authorising a Stage Plan (DP3). The\nbenefits these End Stage Assessments bring to the project are:\n* providing a ‘fire break’ for the project by encouraging the Project Board to\n  assess the project viability at regular intervals, rather than let it run on in an\n  uncontrolled manner\n* ensuring that key decisions are made prior to the detailed work needed to\n  implement them. The nature of these decisions can be varied and will\n  include:\n  - whether to commit major resources such as capital investment\n  - what the impact is of major risk elements\n  - the clarification of a previously unknown or ill understood part of the\n    project’s direction or products.\n* clarifying what the impact will be of an identified external influence such as\n   the corporate budget round or the finalisation of legislation.\n7.2.2 Planning horizons\nUncertainty can often mean that it is only possible to plan in detail the activities\nand products of a limited amount of the work of the project. The rest of the project’s\nwork can only by planned in broad outline. The adoption of stages handles this\nsituation by having two different but related levels of plan, i.e. a detailed Stage Plan\nand an outline Project Plan.\n7.2.3   Scale\nEvery project should consist of at least two stages. A small project may need only\ntwo stages; an Initiation Stage and the remainder of the project is the second stage.\nThe Initiation Stage may last only a matter of hours, but is essential to ensure that\nthere is a firm basis for the project, understood by all parties.\nMost projects need to be broken down into more manageable stages to enable the\ncorrect level of planning and control to be exercised.\n7.3     Management versus Technical Stages\nOne method of grouping work together in stages is by the set of techniques used or\nthe product created. This results in stages covering elements such as design, build\nand implementation. Such stages are technical stages and are a separate concept\nfrom the management stages introduced above.\nTechnical stages are typified by the use of a particular set of specialist skills.\nManagement stages equate to commitment of resources and authority to spend.\n",
    "68": "Often the two types of stage will coincide; for instance, where the management\ndecision is based on the output from the technical stage. An example of this might\nbe where the output from the technical stage is a set of design options.\nHowever, on other occasions the stages will not coincide. There might be more than\none technical stage per management stage. For example, the Project Board might\ndecide to combine all the technical stages which investigate a need and produce a\nspecification into one management stage. One plan would be approved to cover all\nthe work, with Project Board commitment before the work started and a review at\nthe end. In a risky project, e.g. one which is (technically) innovative, a technical stage\nmight be divided into more than one management stage.\nThe PRINCE approach is to concentrate the management of the project on the\nmanagement stages since these will form the basis of the planning and control\nprocesses described throughout the method. To do otherwise runs the risk of the\nproject being driven by the specialist teams, instead of the Customer’s\nmanagement.\nWhere the desired management stages do not coincide with the technical stages,\ntechnical work can be broken down so that its activities can be divided over two\nmanagement stages. Figure 21 gives an example of this break,\nProject\nSpecify\nDesign\nBuild\nTrain\nCommission\nStage 1\n2\n3\n4\nA\nC\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nFigure 21: Technical activities broken down to fit within management stages\nFigure 21 shows that Design has been broken into three activities. Part B now falls\nwithin Stage 1. Part C of Design and part D of Training form the second\nmanagement stage, and part E of Design is planned to be done in Stage 3.\n",
    "69": "7.4     How to define stages\nThe process of defining stages is fundamentally a process of balancing:\n* how far ahead in the project it is sensible to plan\n* where the key decision points need to be on the project\n* too many small stages versus too few big ones.\nThis will be a balance of the factors identified above, and will be influenced by any\nteam plans. However, the Project Manager will have to reconcile these two types of\nplan. This is discussed in the Planning chapter.\n7.5     How to use stages\nThe primary use of stages is as a basis for dictating the timing of the stage\nboundary processes covered by Managing Stage Boundaries (SB), and by the\nassociated Authorising a Stage (DP3). These processes are used to make decisions\nregarding the continuation or otherwise of the project.\nOne element of this decision-making process is whether the stage which has just\ncompleted has completed successfully. This can be problematic where the\nmanagement stage ends part way through one or more elements of specialist work,\nsince it can be difficult to establish whether the specialist work is under control. The\nPRINCE technique of Product-based planning is invaluable here since by using it the\nProject Manager can identify the detailed products involved in any element of\nspecialist work, and can hence identify all the products which are due to be\nproduced within the confines of any given management stage. This can then be used\nto assess completion or otherwise of the stage.\nDriving this will be Planning a Project (IP1).\n",

Project\nmanagement must control and contain risks if a project is to stand a chance of being\nsuccessful.\nThis section covers the main aspects of the management of risk as they apply to\nproject management\n8.2     What is risk?\nRisk is defined as:\n‘the chance of exposure to the adverse consequences of future events’\nProjects are set up to bring about change, and hence project work is less predictable\nthan is typically the case with routine work. The project is unique and usually its\nobjectives have to be achieved within certain constraints. In addition, projects can\nbe large and complex, and can deal with novel or unusual factors.\nThere are a number of ‘standard’ risks which may affect the project (i.e. they affect\nall projects).  Some examples of these appear under the next heading Types of Risk.\nThere will be other risks which are project-specific, i.e. they exist because of a\nparticular project and its circumstances.\nManagement of risk is an essential part of project management. There are a number\nof techniques available which can be used.\n",
    "71": "8.3    Types of Risk\nBroadly, there are two types of risk – Business risk and Project risk.\n8.3.1 Business risk\nThis covers the threats associated with a project not delivering products which can\nachieve the expected benefits. It is the responsibility of the Project Board to manage\nbusiness risks. This is described in Directing a Project (DP). It includes such areas as:\n* the validity and viability of the Business Case\n* whether the project continues to support the corporate business strategy,\n* including such elements as:\n  - strategic direction\n  - commercial issues\n  - market change\n* the consequences to the corporate body of failure or limited success\n* the stability of the business areas involved\n* programme requirements\n* legislative changes\n* political factors including public opinion\n* environmental issues\n* impact on the Customer of the results of the project\n* the risks of the end result meeting the stated requirements, but not fulfilling\n  expectations.\n8.3.2     Project risk\nThis is the collection of threats to the management of the project and hence to the\nachievement of the project’s end results within cost and time. These risks may be\nmanaged on a day-to-day basis by the Project Board, Project Manager or Team\nLeader. Risks will be many and varied, but would include the following broad\ncategories:\n* procurement issues, covering those risks caused by being dependent on a\n  third party, including:\n  - failure of the third party\n  - failure by them to deliver satisfactorily\n  - contractual issues\n  - mismatch between the nature of the task and the procurement process\n* organisational factors such as:\n  - additional staff responsibilities alongside project work\n  - the project culture, or lack of it, within the Customer organisation\n  - personnel and training issues\n  - skill shortage\n  - potential security implications\n  - culture clashes between Customer and Supplier\n* specialist issues; there will be a wide variety of issues here because each\nproject has its own particular specialist elements which bring with them\ntheir own risk elements. However, there are some general issues which will\napply to many project types, such as:\n  - how well requirements can be specified\n  - to what extent the requirements can be met using currently available and\n    understood facilities and approaches\n",
    "72": "- the extent to which a project involves innovative, difficult or complex\n    processes and /or equipment\n  - the challenges and problems regarding quality testing\n  - the risks that the specified requirements will not be achievable in full, or\n    that not all requirements will be correctly specified.\nIt must be stressed that the above lists are given purely to illustrate the areas of risk\nwhich need to be considered as part of project management. Each project must be\nconsidered in its own right.\nOnce identified, risks are not kept separate (e.g. business, project, Stage Plan). They\nare all entered in the one Risk Log which is always reviewed in its entirety.\n8.4     Managing risk\nThe management of risk is one of the most important parts of the Project Board’s\nand Project Manager’s jobs. The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring that\nrisks are identified, recorded and regularly reviewed. The Project Board has three\nresponsibilities:\n* notifying the Project Manager of any external risk exposure to the project\n* making decisions on the Project Manager’s recommended reactions to risk\n* striking a balance between level of risk and potential benefits which the\n  project may achieve.\nThe Project Manager modifies plans to include agreed actions to avoid or reduce the\nimpact of risks. An ‘owner’ should be identified for each risk, who should be the\nperson best situated to keep an eye on it. The Project Manager will normally suggest\nthe ‘owner’ and the Project Board should make the decision. Project Board members\nmay be appointed ‘owners’ of risks, particularly risks from sources external to the\nproject.\nIn order to contain the risks during the project, they must be managed in a\ndisciplined manner. This discipline consists of:\n* risk analysis, which involves the identification and definition of risks, plus\n  the evaluation of impact and consequent action\n* risk management, which covers the activities involved in the planning,\n  monitoring and controlling of actions which will address the threats and\n  problems identified, so as to improve the likelihood of the project achieving\n  its stated objectives.\nFigure 23 shows the major activities in the management of risk.\nThe risk analysis and risk management phases must be treated separately, to ensure\nthat decisions are made objectively and based on all the relevant information.\nRisk analysis and risk management are inter-related and undertaken iteratively. The\nformal recording of information is an important element in risk analysis and risk\nmanagement. The documentation provides the foundation which supports the\noverall management of risk.\nRisk analysis requires input from the management of the organisation. The\norganisation’s management, in turn, is kept informed by the analysis in a highly\niterative manner. Communication is particularly important between the project and\nprogramme levels within the organisation.\n",
    "73": "Identification\nEstimation\nEvaluation\nPlanning\nResourcing\nControlling\nMonitoring\nRisk Analysis\n    Risk Management\nFigure 23: The Major Activities in the Management of Risk\nWhere the project is part of a programme, the management of risk procedures used\nby the project must be the same as those of the programme unless there are valid\nreasons not to do so. Where a risk is uncovered in the programme, any affected\nprojects should be involved in the analysis of that risk. SimilarIy project risk\nevaluation should include staff from the programme.\n8.4.1    Risk analysis\nRisk analysis is essential for effective management of risk. It comprises three\nactivities:\n* risk identification, which determines the potential risks that could be faced\nby the project\n* risk estimation, which determines how important each risk is, based on an\n  assessment of its likelihood and consequences to the project and business\n* risk evaluation, which decides whether the level of each risk is acceptable or\n  not and, if not, what actions can be taken to make it more acceptable.\nThe actions break into broadly five types:\n* prevention, where countermeasures are put in place which either stop the\n  threat or problem from occurring, or prevent it having any impact on the\n  project or business\n* reduction, where the actions either reduce the likelihood of the risk\n  developing, or limit the impact on the project to acceptable levels\n* transference, which is a specialist form of risk reduction where the impact of\n  the risk is passed to a third party via, for instance, an insurance policy or\n  penalty clause\n* contingency, where actions are planned and organised to come into force as\n  and when the risk occurs\n* acceptance, where the Project Board decides to go ahead and accept the\n  possibility that the risk might occur (believing that either the risk will not\n  occur or the countermeasures are too expensive).\n",
    "74": "Any given risk could have appropriate actions in any or all of the above categories.\nAlternatively, there may be no cost-effective actions available to deal with a risk, in\nwhich case the risk must be accepted, or the justification for the project re-visited, i.e.\nis the project too risky?\nThe results of the risk analysis activities are documented in the Risk Log. If the\nproject is part of a programme, project risks should be examined for any impact on\nthe programme (and vice versa). Where any cross-impact is found the risk should\nbe added to the other Risk Log.\nRisk analysis activities are overlapping, with possibly many iterations involved.\nRisk analysis is a process which will be conducted continuously throughout the\nproject as information becomes available, and as circumstances change. However,\nthere is a need to carry out a major risk analysis at the start of the project as part of\nthe processes:\n* Preparing a Project Brief (SU4)\n* Planning a Project (IP2)\n* Refining the Business Case (IP3).\nProject risks may, in turn, impact the Business Case. There must also be at least an\nassessment of all risks during Managing Stage Boundaries (SB). Depending on the\nindividual project, there may be a need to re-assess risks on a more frequent basis.\nThe Project Manager and Project Board must constantly be on the lookout for new\nor changed risks in the business and project environment, which will render the\nproject (as currently planned) wasteful or useless.\n8.4.2    Risk management\nOnce the risks have been identified and evaluated, attention needs to focus on\nmanaging them. Risk management logically follows risk analysis, though, as with\nanalysis, the two phases will overlap and often be done in parallel.\nRisk management consists of four major activities:\n* planning, which, for the countermeasure actions itemised during the risk\n  evaluation activities, consists of:\n  - identifying the quantity and type of resources required to carry out the\n    actions\n  - developing a detailed plan of action to be included in a Stage Plan\n  - confirming the desirability of carrying out the actions identified during\n    risk evaluation in the light of any additional information gained\n  - obtaining management approval along with all the other aspects of the\n    plans being produced\n* resourcing, which will identify and assign the resources to be used for the\n  work to carry out the risk avoidance or amelioration actions; these\n  assignments will be shown in Stage Plans; the resources required for the\n  prevention, reduction and transference actions will have to be funded from\n  the project budget, since they are actions which the project is committed to\n  carry out; decisions have to be made on how contingent actions will be\n  funded\n",
    "75": "* monitoring, which consists of:\n  - checking that execution of the planned actions is having the desired effect\n    on the risks identified\n  - watching for the early warning signs that a risk is developing\n  - modelling trends, predicting potential risks\n  - checking that the overall management of risk is being applied effectively\n* controlling, which is taking action to ensure that the events of the plan\n  really happen.\nRisk management continues throughout the project. However, as a minimum,\nactions will need to be carried out at the following points in the project\nmanagement cycle.\nRisk planning and resourcing should be done in the processes:\n* Analysing Risks (PL6)\n* Executing a Work Package (MP2)\n* Updating the Risk Log (SB4).\nRisk monitoring and controlling should be carried out throughout the project.\nDuring Closing a Project (CP) Follow-up Actions will need to be considered for any\noutstanding risks which will continue into the product’s useful life.\nHints and tips for Risk\nWhere the project is part of a programme:\nThe Programme Manager is responsible for ensuring the management of project-related\nrisks, particularly those associated with interdependencies between projects\nand programme-wide risks.\nThe Business Change Manager is responsible for assuring that the approach being\ntaken to managing risks is appropriate.\nThe Design Authority monitors risks associated with the programme’s products.\nWhere appropriate the Programme Director should take part in the risk procedure\nat the project level. This can normally be done by attendance at End Stage\nAssessments.\nRisks are frequently common across projects and would benefit from being\ncentralised at program me level. The cost of corrective action can be reduced if it is\nplanned, agreed and actioned only once. Also problems can result from an\ninconsistent approach being taken by projects.\n",

Projects should not rely on implied needs. These lead to uncertainty and, as\nsuch, are of little use.\n",
    "77": "9.3     Quality Management\nQuality Management is the process of ensuring that the quality expected by the\nCustomer is achieved. It encompasses all the project management activities which\ndetermine and implement the Project’s Quality Plan. The various elements of an\norganisation’s quality management interrelate and are as follows:\n* a Quality System with an organisation structure, procedures and processes\n  to implement quality management. Both the Customer and the Supplier may\n  have quality systems. The project may have to use one of these systems or an\n  agreed mixture of both. PRINCE itself will typically form part of a corporate\n  quality system where it has been adopted as a corporate standard.\n* Quality Assurance, which sets up the quality system and is the means of\n  assuring that the quality system operates to achieve an end product which\n  meets quality and customer requirements. It creates and maintains the\n  quality system, audits and evaluates it. A quality assurance function may be\n  set up separate from and independent of the organisation’s project and\n  operational activities to monitor use of the quality system across all projects\n  within the corporate body. If such an independent body does not exist, the\n  project assurance function within the project will assume the quality\n  assurance role.\n* Quality Planning which establishes the objectives and requirements for\n  quality and lays out the activities for the application of the quality system.\n  In the Project Initiation Document the quality approach for the whole project\n  is defined in the Project Quality Plan. It is important that the Customer’s\n  quality expectations are understood and documented prior to project\n  commencement. This is done in Starting up a Project (S U). Each Stage Plan\n  specifies in detail the required quality activities and resources, with the\n  detailed quality criteria shown in the Product Descriptions.\n* Quality Control, which is the means of ensuring that products meet the\n  quality criteria specified for them. Quality control is about examining\n  products to determine that they meet requirements.\n9.3.1     Product Descriptions\nThe Product Description may need to be updated if a change to the product is\nagreed.\nA Product Description should not be changed, once approved, without passing\nthrough change control.\n9.3.2     Quality Review\nThe Quality Review is the primary technique in making project quality work for\nPRINCE.

As such, any required quality management for the project may\nhave to be created for that project if the organisation does not already have a\nquality system in place.\n9.5     Making project quality work\nProject quality planning must cover the following agreements to ensure that the\nproject delivers to an acceptable level of quality:\n* how each product will be tested against its quality criteria\n* when each product will be tested against its quality criteria\n* by whom each product will be tested against its quality criteria.\nThe first aspect is actioned by Planning Quality (lP1 ) at the outset of the project,\nduring Initiating a Project. The last two aspects are actioned in the relevant Stage\nQuality Plans, created in Planning a Stage (SBI).\nQuality is achieved by a combination of actions. The quality criteria for all levels of\nproduct are stated in measurable terms in the Product Descriptions (this is\ndescribed in Product-based planning). The process of producing the products and\nservices is controlled via Authorising Work Package (CSI ) and Assessing Progress\n(CS2).\nThe final aspect is the process of using all the quality checking techniques defined\nin the Quality System. These split largely into two groups:\n* objective methods, where, after applying them, there is a largely definitive\n  ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to whether the deliverable is ‘to quality’. Examples of\n  these methods are the use of gauges and meters, testing and checklists.\n* subjective methods, where the criteria involve either judgement or opinion,\n  such as user-friendliness, conformance to business strategy and market\n  acceptability.

If more than one version of a product\nhas been created, then Configuration Management is being performed. It is just a\nquestion of how well it is being done.\n10.2     What is Configuration Management?\nConfiguration Management may be thought of as product control.\nThe construction of a car is a good example of the need for Configuration\nManagement. What components have to be brought together in order to assemble\nthe car? What about that recent change to the fascia – and the redesigned\nwindscreen wipers? How can the assemblers be sure that they have the correct\ncomponents? The answer is – from the records held by Configuration Management.\n",

Each product brought under Configuration Management\ncontrol is known as a configuration item. The title given to the person (or group)\noperating the Configuration Management method is Configuration Librarian.\nConfiguration Management consists of four basic functions:\n* identification – specifying and identifying all components of the final\n  product\n* control – the ability to agree and ‘freeze’ configuration items and then to\n  make changes only with the agreement of appropriate named authorities.\n  Once a product has been approved, the motto is ‘Nothing moves, nothing\n  changes without authorisation’\n* status accounting – the recording and reporting of all current and historical\n  data concerned with each configuration item\n* verification – a series of reviews and audits to ensure that there is\n  conformity between the project’s products and the authorised state of\n  configuration items as registered in the Configuration Management records.\n10.3     Configuration Management and Change Control\nThere must be a close liaison between Configuration Management and Change\nControl.

The context diagram\nshows all the information flows in and out of the process. The diagram for each\nmajor process only shows the major information flows to avoid becoming too\ncomplex to read.\nProcess description\nThis section describes the process by explaining the objectives and how the process\nfulfils the fundamental principles, and gives a description of the steps involved in\ncarrying out the process.\nNo attempt has been made to lay out the steps in a strict sequence, since such a\nhard and fast sequence seldom exists. However, they have been listed in as logical a\nsequence as possible.\nResponsibilities\nThis section specifies who should be accountable for the successful conduct of the\nmajor process, and responsible for its management. These are only stated for the\nprocesses, as it is at that level that responsibilities can be decided.\nInformation needs\nThis section contains a table of the important information required for the process\nto function and achieve its objectives.

The Project Board manages by exception,\nmonitors via reports and controls through a number of decision points.\nThe key processes for the Project Board break into four main areas:\n* Initiation (starting the project off on the right foot)\n* Stage boundaries (commitment of more resources after checking results so\n  far)\n* Ad hoc direction (monitoring progress, providing advice and guidance,\n  reacting to exception situations)\n* Project closure (confirming the project outcome and bringing the project to a\n  controlled close).\nThis process does not cover the day-to-day activities of the Project Manager\n12.3.2     Starting up a Project (SU)\nThis is the first process in PRINCE. It is a pre-project process, designed to ensure\nthat the pre-requisites for initiating the project are in place. The process expects the\nexistence of a Project Mandate which defines in high level terms the reason for the\nproject and what outcome is sought. Starting up a Project (SU) should be very short.\nThe work of the process is built around the production of three elements:\n* ensuring that the information required for the Project Brief is available\n* designing and appointing the Project Management Team\n* creating the Initiation Stage Plan.\n12.3.3 Initiating a Project (IP)\nThe objectives of Initiating a Project are to:\n* agree whether or not there is sufficient justification to proceed with the\n  project\n* establish a stable management basis on which to proceed\n  document and confirm that an acceptable Business Case exists for the project\n* ensure a firm and accepted foundation to the project prior to commencement\n  of the work\n* agree to the commitment of resources for the first stage of the project\n",

Where decisions are\nrequired which are outside the defined authority of the Project Board, these must be\nreferred to the programme Director for a decision.\nThe key processes for the Project Board are predominantly event-driven and target\nthe Project Board members to a small number of key decision points, plus informal\ndiscussions where required. These key processes break into four main areas:\n* Initiation (starting the project off on the right foot)\n* Stage boundaries (commitment to further work after checking results so far)\n* Ad hoc direction (monitoring progress, providing advice and guidance)\n* Project closure (confirming the project outcome and bringing the project to a\n  controlled close).\n15.2.1    Initiation\nCorporate or programme management should confirm the appointment of the\nProject Board and other Project Management Team members which is done in\nAppointing a Project Board Executive and a Project Manager (SU1) and Appointing a\nProject Management Team (SU3).

Planning an Initiation Stage (SU6) is where the Initiation Stage Plan is\nprepared.\nAt the end of the Initiation Stage, the Project Board must agree whether it makes\nsound business sense to continue with the project. If so, and if they approve the\nProject Plan, the Project Board gives the go-ahead for the next stage.\n15.2.2    Stage boundaries\nAs part of the Initiation Stage the Project Board and Project Manager will agree on\nthe division of the project into stages. The division is normally proposed by the\nProject Manager and accepted by the Project Board during informal discussions\nafter production of a draft Project Plan.\nBasically the Project Board only authorises the Project Manager to proceed with one\nstage at a time. Between stages the Project Board reviews the whole project status\nbefore approving the next Stage Plan if it is satisfied that the Business Case still\nstands and the project will deliver what is required.\nIf problems occur during a stage, the Project Board may be asked by the Project\nManager to approve Exception Plans, which will bring the stage back under control.\nThis is as part of ‘management by exception’.\n15.2.3     Ad hoc direction\nThe Project Board’s main objectives are to provide overall direction and guidance\nthroughout the project and to ensure that the project and the products remain\nconsistent with business plans. Activities to achieve these objectives are formally\ndefined as part of the Stage Plans, but the Project Board will want to support these\nactivities by receiving appropriate reports on key elements from the Project\nManager.\nThe Project Board must maintain a feedback on project progress to corporate or\nprogramme management during the project.\nThe Project Board must also be mindful of any changes in the corporate strategy or\nthe external environment, and reflect the impact of such changes when directing the\nProject Manager.\n15.2.4 Project Closure\nThe project ends with confirmation by the Project Board that everything expected\nhas been delivered to the correct level of quality and that, where applicable, it is in\na state where it can be used, operated, supported and sustained.\nThere may be follow-on actions as a result of the project, about which the Project\nBoard must make decisions and refer to the appropriate bodies.\nA date and plan for a Post Implementation Review can be agreed. This is a point in\nthe future when the benefits of the project and the performance of the finished\nproduct can be assessed.

The expected benefits and savings\nshould be supplied and approved by the Customer.  The project costs should come from\nthe Project Manager and match the Project Plan.\nRisk Log\nThe Project Management Team should identify any risks (see the Management of Risk\nchapter) facing the project’s products.  The Project Board should ensure that there is an\nassessment of the risks, plus appropriate countermeasures and, where appropriate,\ncontingency plans.\nProject Plan\nThe Project Plan gives an overall view of the major products, timescale and cost for the\nproject.  Any wide variation between this and any previous forecast for the project (e.g.\none done as part of a Feasibility Study) should be examined, and the Project Board\nshould assure themselves of the continued validity and achievability of the plan and\nreasons for the variation.  The Project Plan needs to be co-ordinated with any relevant\nstrategic and programme management plans.\nProject Organisation\nMost, if not all, of the appointments of the Project Management Team will have been\nfinalised during the Start-up process.

This should be carefully described in the\njob definitions of the Executive and Senior Supplier.\nWhere there is a wide differential between the Business Cases of the Customer and\nthe Supplier, it is less likely that consistent and compatible decisions and actions\nwill occur. Consider if knowledge and understanding of the Business Case\ndifferentials would assist in assuring compatible behaviour.\nTight time constraints will tend to mitigate against the type of project relationship\nwhich requires extensive, formal controls and communications between Customer\nand Supplier. Review the standard PRINCE controls and their frequency in the\nlight of any time constraints.\nWhen approving the Project Initiation Document, it should not be forgotten that\nthe next Stage Plan also needs approval.\nWhere funding for the project is variable, stage approval should include assurance\nthat funds for the stage are set aside. The choice and timing of stages may be done\nto reflect any need to confirm continued funding.\n15.5 Authorising a Stage or Exception Plan (DP3)\n15.5.1 Fundamental principles\nIt is important that work commences on a stage only when the Project Board says it\nshould; this avoids the problems of projects continuing just because no one thinks\nto stop them.\nTo enable this to happen, the project should be broken down into manageable\nsections (stages) at the end of which the Project Board has to approve whether work\nis to continue or not.\nIt is also important to spot problems early and react to them.\n",

The detailed forecast should match the updated or\nrevised Project Plan.\nThe updated Project Plan and Business Case are compared with what they were at\nthe start of the project (and at the start of the last stage) to check that the project is\nstill viable.\nAny changes to the Business Case defined in the Project Mandate or Project Brief\nmust be communicated to corporate or programme management.\nThe process may also be invoked when the stage or project is forecast to exceed its\ntolerance levels.

Make sure that the stage\nboundary issues are discussed somewhere near the end of stage rather than risk\nthat no discussion is held because people are not available.\nMake sure that there are ‘no surprises’ from the outset, i.e. the project situation\nshould be discussed informally between the Project Manager and Project Board\nand any problems sorted out before any formal request for authorisation of the\nnext stage.\nAlthough a stage may stay within its tolerances, information may be produced\nwithin a stage which shows that at some time in the future the project will exceed\nits tolerances. An example would be information that the cost of equipment to be\nbought a year down the line will exceed the project budget tolerance. It is important\nthat these types of issue are discussed as early as possible, so they should still be\nraised with the Project Board.\nWhere the project deviates significantly from its tolerances, it may be better to\nstop the current project and restart with a Project Initiation Document which\nreflects the new situation.\nIn small projects the Project Board and Project Manager may agree to an informal\nEnd Stage Assessment and authorisation to proceed to the next stage.

Project Issues include:\n* a change in requirements, however minor (even apparently very minor\n  changes can have major long-term implications)\n* a change in the environment applicable to the project, e.g.:\n  - a legislative change\n  - a corporate change of direction\n  - a new Customer\n  - a new Supplier\n",

There may be a company standard or the customer may\nstipulate the use of a particular set of tools. The choice of planning tool may in part,\nhowever, depend on the complexity of the project. If so, the choice may need to be\ndeferred until after some of the other planning processes.\n",

The Project Plan is mandatory. The division of the project\ninto stages may already be defined (by common practice or work done previously).\nThe identification and selection of stages is discussed in Planning a Project (IP2). The\nnumber of levels of plan will be dictated by the level of control required and the\nscale of the project. It may be valid to restrict the number of levels because the\nadditional work involved in maintaining more plans does not justify the extra\nlevels.\nThe Planning and Stages components in this manual describe the PRINCE concept of\nplan levels. The number of levels chosen for the project should reflect a balance\nbetween:\n* the different information and control needs of the Project Manager and\n  Project Board\n* the effort of creating extra plans\n* the problems involved in ensuring compatibility between different plan\n  levels.\nThere should be an agreed definition of the contents and level of detail for each\nlevel of plan which it has been decided will be required. Examples here would be:\n* to what level of detail should the Project Plan go?\n* what is the maximum length of time for any activity in a stage or lower level\n  without further breakdown?\n* how is the quality work to be shown on the various plans?\n* who is to be involved in planning the quality activities in a Stage or Team\n  Plan?\nEstimating\nThe method(s) of estimation must be chosen.

Producing Exception Plans to ask the\n  Project Board for extra money to cover the implementation of Requests for\n  Change is the basic process, but this can be irritating if it has to be done\n  frequently. If the environment suggests that there will be many changes\n  during the project it is sensible to discuss with the Project Board whether\n  there should be a change budget. If so, consideration must be given to how\n  this should be handled when producing the plans.\n* Contingency Plans\n  In the Management of Risk a Contingency Plan is one answer to the question\n  ‘What do we do if this risk occurs?’. Where a serious risk exists, the Project\n  Board may require the Project Manager to create a Contingency Plan and\n  add the necessary budget for it – only to be used if the risk occurs.\n  These are not mandatory and their use depends on each project’s circumstances.\n20.4.4      Responsibilities\nUltimately the responsibility for the decisions in designing a plan rests with the\nProject Board, but in practice the Project Manager would produce recommendations\nfor informal Project Board approval.

A good tool can also validate that\nthe correct dependencies have been built in and have not been corrupted by any\nplan updates.\nIf there is a need to use Team Plans, the Stage Plan would normally act as a\nsummary of the key start and end dates, together with any interfaces between the\nTeam Plans and with the external environment.\nThe Project Manager should decide what level of efficiency is to be taken for project\nmembers when planning their work. No-one is 100% efficient. The estimator must\nknow how to treat non-planned time such as telephone calls, ad hoc meetings,\nsickness.\nWatch out for ‘double counting’, e.g. adding in allowances both when estimating\nand when scheduling.\nThe Project Manager should decide in conjunction with the Project Board how to\nbudget for contingency, i.e. the allowance for possible estimating shortfalls, delays,\noverlooked products or activities. This is especially critical in fixed-price work.\nThe amount of contingency budget added should be documented to assist with\nfuture estimation, together with how much is actually used.\nSmall projects may only have one plan after the Initiation Stage Plan, and, therefore,\none level of plan. It may be sensible to consider different levels of presentation of\nthe plan for the different levels of readership. Most planning software packages\noffer such options.\nWhen working with sub-contractor companies, a copy of their plan(s) may form\npart of the overall plan. A decision will need to be taken on whether sub-contractor\nplans are shown separately or built into the Project and/or Stage Plans.\nNot all projects need a 45-page plan, but equally a half-sheet of paper is likely to\nbe insufficient for most Project Plans.\nWhere the project is part of a programme, the programme may have developed a\ncommon approach to project planning. This may cover standards (e.g. level of\nplanning) and tools, These will be the starting point for designing any Project\nPlans.

Examples of external constraints may be:\n* the delivery of a product required by this project from another project\n* waiting for a decision from programme management.\nWherever possible, external constraints should be described as a dependency on the\navailability of an external product.

Specific skills may be required depending on the nature of the\n  project, i.e. type and complexity. Requirements may include non-human\n  resources, such as equipment, travel, money.\n  It is important to agree a definition of resource types.

At this point the estimates will be approximate (i.e. provisional\n  estimates).\n  The reliability of estimates depends on:\n  - how detailed is the understanding of the activity\n  - the assumptions made\n  - understanding the products (from the Product Descriptions).\nThe assumptions that underpin the estimate, the margin of error and the\ndegree of confidence in the estimate should be recorded in the plan. This\ninformation will enable the Project Board to set appropriate tolerances.\nTolerances are fully described in Controls.

The activity numbers correspond to the activity list in\n  Figure 79.\nThe number on the left above each box is the duration time for that activity.\nThe number on the right above the box is the Earliest Finish Time for that\nactivity. For example, the Earliest Finish Time for activity 20 is day 6\n(activity 15 takes 4 days and activity 20 takes 2 days).\n* Assess resource availability\n  The number of people who will be available to do the work (or the cost of\n  buying-in resources) should now be established. Any specific information\n  should also be noted, e.g. names, level of experience, percentage availability,\n  dates available from and to, external or internal resource. The project may\n  also require non-human resources; this availability must also be assessed.\n* Produce a draft schedule and assign responsibilities\n  Using the resource availability and the information from the activity\n  network, resources are now allocated to activities. The rule is ‘allocate\n  resources in order of ascending float’, i.e. allocate resources first to activities\n  with zero float (on the Critical Path). Those activities with the greatest\n  amount of spare time (float) are lowest in priority for resource allocation.\n  The result will be a schedule which shows the loading of work on each\n  person and the usage of non-people resources. The duration of each activity\n  can be amended, based on knowledge of the resource effort required and the\n  availability of the appropriate resource type.\n  The schedule is often displayed as a Gantt chart.

The benefit of the protection against risks is valuable, but remember\nto allow for the ‘cost’ of these activities in the plan.\nWhere the project is part of a programme, any risks identified at programme level\nshould be examined for impact on the project.

It is incomplete without certain supporting\nnarrative sections.\n20.10.2    Context\nHaving completed the schedule and assessment of the risks satisfactorily, the plan\nand its supporting text need to be consolidated by the Project Manager for\npresentation to the Project Board.\n20.10.3     Process description\nText needs to be added to explain the plan, any constraints on it, external\ndependencies, assumptions made, the risks identified and their required\ncountermeasures. A suggested text for a Project Plan and a Stage Plan is given in\nAppendix A – PRINCE Product outlines.\nThe format of plans presented for approval should be a summary and show the\nmajor products and activities which will occur throughout the plan and describe the\nresource requirements. Project Board approval will ‘freeze’ the plan as a baseline.\nThe graphical presentation of the plan is normally a Gantt or bar chart. Most\ncomputerised planning and control packages provide a report in this format. Such\npackages also provide a report on resource requirements.\nThe majority of the material for the narrative sections of the plan will evolve as the\nprevious steps in the planning cycle are undertaken. Some of it will already be\nknown because of adherence to local standards.\nTolerance margins for the plan should be agreed with the Project Board. Depending\non such factors as size, complexity and risk there must be agreement on what\namount of deviation from planned cost and timescale is to be allowed before the\nplan is considered to be out of control. Tolerances are discussed more fully in\nControls.\nThe products of the planning cycle should be checked for completeness and\nreasonableness, by people experienced in planning and who know the project\nsubject, prior to presenting them formally to the Project Board for approval.\nAmend the plans as required by the quality check.\nThe Product Checklist should now have the planned start and end dates added\nfrom the plan.\nThe Project Plan forms part of the Project Initiation Document and is submitted at\nthe End Stage Assessment of the Initiation Stage.

It is a good discipline to try to keep all graphical plans presented\nto the Project Board to one sheet of paper. In this way the plan is easily prepared,\neasily read and therefore more likely to be understood. Anything which cannot be\ndisplayed in this way should be summarised and the detail included in a lower\nlevel of plan. Similarly, do not use complex symbols, or present plans which require\neducation or too much explanation for them to be understood.\nIt might be worth considering: the replacement of the graphical Project Plan with\nthe Product Checklist.\nDo not rely on pictures alone. As far as planning is concerned, it is not necessarily\ntrue that ‘a picture paints a thousand words’. Although a Gantt chart can show\nwhat is intended to happen, and then what actually happened, it does not show\nwhy it should happen that way, or why something is different from the plan.\nThe narrative of a plan describes the thought that went into the plan, the\nassumptions made in preparing the plan and any risks inherent in the plan. This\nis particularly important when presenting plans for approval. The readers are\nthen able to accept both the plans and the assumptions and risks, and the planner\nobtains informed approval and commitment to the plans from senior management.\nIf can usually be transferred to a spreadsheet or graphical package where the\nrequired presentation can be constructed.\nThe Project Manager should discuss the plan informally with the Project Board\nand any assurance responsibilities appointed by the Project Board before formally\npresenting it for approval.\nThe presentation of the plan should be appropriate for the audience. In some\ncircumstances it may be necessary to break down into further detail areas of a plan\nfor the use of teams or individuals.\nBe wary of producing an overly complex plan, containing lots of detail which\nmight be better supplied in narrative form. A confusing or too detailed plan may\n‘switch off’ the reader.\nIt helps if assumptions are consistent across all the projects of a programme.\n",
    "214": "TECHNIQUES\n21    Product-based planning\nPRINCE provides a product-based framework which can be applied to any project\nto give a logical sequence to the project’s work. The use of this technique is\nrecommended for all levels of plan required in a project. The technique is closely\nallied to Defining and Analysing Products (PL2).\nThere are three steps to the product-based planning technique:\n* producing a Product Breakdown Structure\n* writing Product Descriptions\n* producing a Product Flow Diagram.\n21.1     Product-based planning example\nThe explanation of product-based planning is supported by an example. The basis\nof the example plan is described below.\nA landscape gardener is asked to design and construct the rear garden for a local\nbusinessman, The area is an acre in size, currently waste land filled with post-building\nrubbish, brambles etc. It is bordered by a suitable fence which does not\nneed to be replaced. The businessman says he has some vague ideas about what he\nwants. These include:\n* a large patio\n* a brick-built barbecue on the patio\n* lots of lawn\n* flower beds with lots of colourful shrubs and flowers.\nHe will get a gardener in to look after the garden when it is finished, so he wants a\ngarden shed to be put in a discreet corner of the garden, filled with the tools which\nthe gardener will need.\nAll that is known about the businessman is that he has a lot of money, but getting\nmoney out of him can be difficult. The landscape gardener decides that he will pin\nthe customer down by getting a written specification, then get agreement to a\ndesign. Because of the ‘tightwad’ reputation, the landscape gardener will ask for\npart payments in advance of those products requiring heavy expenditure (Stage\nselection).\nThe example is done at a Project Plan level.\n21.2     Producing a Product Breakdown Structure\nBreaking down a product into its constituent sub-products helps clarify and identify\nall necessary work for its creation.\nThis is the first step in PRINCE product-based planning. The ‘product’ is the end\ndeliverable of the project and may be a tangible one such as a machine, a document\nor a piece of software, or it may be intangible, such as a culture change or a\ndifferent organisation structure. For the purposes of this explanation, these will all\nbe called ‘products’.\n21.2.1    Identifying Products\nThe objective is to identify the products or outcomes, whether business need,\nmanagement or quality, whose creation is the subject of the plan.\n",
    "215": "All the products of the plan are drawn up in a hierarchical structure, known as a\nProduct Breakdown Structure. At the top of the chart is a single box which\nsummarises the overall product of the plan, e.g. a new marketing strategy, a business\nplan, a new car, a computer system, a new employment policy. This is then\ndecomposed into three boxes which represent:\n* the products whose development is the subject of the plan, plus\n* the management ‘products’\n* quality ‘products’ which will be created to support the management and\n  control of the plan.\nThis decomposure into three legs is purely a device to remind the planner to think\nof the management and quality products.\nEach of these boxes is then decomposed into its major parts to form the next level of\nthe structure. Each of these ‘boxes’ may then be decomposed until an appropriate\nlevel of detail for the plan in question is reached. Figure 82 shows an example of the\ntypical management products branch of a Product Breakdown Structure. Figure 83\nshows a hierarchy of the standard quality products.

This will be a draft which is liable to be\nrefined and amended as the product becomes better understood and the later\nplanning steps are done. A Product Description should be baselined when the plan\ncontaining its creation is baselined.\nA documented and agreed Product Description ensures that all personnel affected\nby that product have the same understanding. A description should be written for\neach significant product to ensure that it is understood, to provide a pointer to the\nway in which the product is to be presented, and to define the quality expectations\nfor it.\n21.3.1 Product Description contents\nA Product Description needs to define a number of things about the product.\nInformation is needed about:\n* Product Title\n* Purpose\n  What purpose will this product fulfil? Is it a means to an end, or an end in\n  itself?\n* Composition\n  What are the components of the product? For example, if the product is a\n  document, this would be a list of the expected chapters or sections. For a\n  low-level component, this section will be a description of the product.\n* Derivation\n  What are the source products from which this product is derived? Examples\n  are:\n  - a design is derived from a specification\n  - a product is bought in from a Supplier\n  - a product is obtained from another department or team.\n* Format and Presentation\n  Is there a standard appearance to which the finished product must conform?\n* Allocated to\n  To whom has the job of creating the product been given?\n* Quality Criteria\n  To what quality specification must the product be produced, and what\n  quality measurements will be applied by those inspecting the finished\n  product? This might be a simple reference to one or more common standards\n  which are documented elsewhere, or it might be a full explanation of some\n  yardstick to be applied.\n* The Type of Quality Check Required\n  What kind of test, inspection or review is to be used to check the quality or\n  functionality?\n* The people or skills required for reviewing/testing and approving the\n  product.\n  Either identification of the people who are to check the quality, an indication\n  of the skills required to do so, or a pointer to which area(s) should supply\n  the checking resources. Identification of the actual people may be left until\n  planning the stage in which the quality check is to be done.\nIf there are any relevant checklists covering the product’s development, these\nshould also be identified in the description.\nAny changes to a Product Description after it is baselined must pass through\nchange control.\n",

It should not be necessary for each project to\nre-define these unless there are changes to them.\nWriting good Product Descriptions is not a trivial undertaking. In particular,\nquality criteria, determining an acceptable product from an unacceptable one, need\ncareful thought.\nIt is a good start to get the User or Customer involved in the writing of Product\nDescriptions, defining quality expectations and in deciding how the product can\nbe checked against these expectations.\nTest the setting of Quality Criteria by asking the question ‘How will I know when\nwork on this product is finished as opposed to stopped ?‘\nListing the composition of a product can often remind the planner of another product\nwhich is needed.\nVery often the same product types are created in many plans. Standard Product\nDescriptions can be written which can be used by many plans.\nAre there any standard checklists which can be used?\nBe careful not to ‘over-engineer’ the Product Description. It exists to help and\nsupport the production and planning processes and is not an end in itself\nDon ‘t try to ‘replace’ the requirements specifications with a Product Description.\nIf the Quality Criteria for a product are agreed with the Customer, this may assist\nin the ultimate acceptance of the project.\nIf Product Descriptions are used as control documents, then additional information,\nsuch as estimated and actual dates and effort may be added.\nIdentifying who will accept a particular product, and making sure that they agree\nto the Product Description, can reduce the potential for conflict at later stages of\nthe project.\n",
    "221": "21.4    Producing a Product Flow Diagram\nThe Product Flow Diagram is created from the Product Breakdown Structure and\nprecedes the identification of activities in Planning (PL3).\n21.4.1    Creating a Product Flow Diagram\nEvery planner needs to know the answer to the question, ‘What comes next?’. The\nProduct Flow Diagram shows the sequence of development of the products of the\nplan. It also identifies dependencies on any products outside the scope of this plan.\nA Product Flow Diagram needs very few symbols. Time flows in one direction only,\neither from top to bottom or from left to right. Each product to be developed within\nthe plan in question is enclosed in a box, and the boxes connected by arrows,\nshowing the sequence in which they are to be created. Any products which should\nalready exist or which come from work outside the scope of the plan should be\nclearly identified by using a different type of enclosure, e.g. an ellipse.\nThe diagram begins with those products which are available at the start of the plan\n(perhaps many of these are documents, such as statements of requirements or\ndesigns) and ends with the final product of the plan. It is often easiest to fill in the\nmiddle of the flow by working back from the final product, asking the question\n‘which products should be available in order to create this product?’\nCreation of a Product Flow Diagram may reveal new products which are required.\nThese should also be added to the Product Breakdown Structure and Product\nDescriptions should be written for them.\nAlthough the Project Manager is responsible for creation of the Product Flow\nDiagram, it is sensible to use the help of those who are to develop the products\ncontained in the plan. It also enables consistency/validity checking.

    "222": "21.4.2 Key criteria\n* On what other products is each product dependent?\n* Is any product dependent on a product developed outside the scope of this\n  plan?\n* Which products can be developed in parallel?\nHints and tips\nAt project level the dependencies can be rather crude, e.g. not all elements of major\nproduct 1 need to be done before any elements of major product 2 can start. To try\nto break those major products down so that the dependencies can be refined is\nlikely to confuse the diagram. It is better to accept the crude dependencies and\nresolve them at stage planning level.\nThe easiest way to create a flow diagram is to put all the business need products in\ntheir required sequence and then add the management and quality products to the\ncorrect point in the flow.\nPost-its on a whiteboard can be an effective way of developing a Product Flow\nDiagram, particularly where there is likely to be a lot of modification.\nA useful way to get started with the flow of business need products is to ‘top and\ntail’ the diagram, i.e. put the final product at the bottom of a sheet of paper and any\nproducts which are pre-requisite to starting the work at the top (in ellipses). Take\neach product in the list and match it to every other product to establish if there is\nany particular dependency between them. Work through all the products in this\nway. Use this information to connect all the products in their appropriate sequence\nfrom such pre-requisites as there are to the final product.\nIf Project Board approvals are listed as management products, their later placement\nin the sequence will show where the stage ends should come, if this is not already\nknown.\nThe Derivation section of a Product Description gives useful information about\ndependencies.\nIt is useful to show the source of any products from third parties in the Product\nFlow Diagram.\nThe Project Board may find that the Product Flow Diagram and Product Checklist\nare easy to use to check on plan progress.\n22     Change Control approach\nA programme or corporate body may have its own change control procedure and\nforms. This is not a problem as long as its key points are compatible with the\napproach detailed below.\nFor those without a mandatory change control procedure, the following will ensure\nthat changes are controlled during the project.\n22.1 Change Control steps\nAll changes are treated as types of Project Issue and are handled through the same\nchange control approach. A Project Issue can be:\n* a request to change the specification of requirements (Request For Change)\n* a suggestion to improve one or more of the project’s products (Request For\n  Change)\n",
    "223": "* a record of some current or forecast failure to meet a requirement (Off-\n  Specification)\n* a question on any project topic.\nWhatever its type, every input is logged as a Project Issue on the Issue Log.\nSuggested content for this log is given in Appendix A – PRINCE Product outlines. It\nallocates a unique number and records the author, date and type of Project Issue.\nThe author should indicate the priority of the Issue. A suggested priority rating is:\n1 a must; the final product will not work without this change\n2 an important change, Its absence would be very inconvenient, although a\n   work-around is possible for a while\n3 a nice-to-have; but not vital\n4 a cosmetic change; of no importance\n5 this does not involve a change.\nA copy of the Project Issue is returned to the author to acknowledge its receipt and\nentry into the system.\nAny Project Issues which are questions or are based on misunderstandings should\nbe answered directly. A reply is sent to the author, a copy filed and the Issue Log\nupdated to reflect the action.\nAn impact analysis is carried out on each remaining Issue to identify:\n* what would have to change\n* what effort would the change need\n* what the impact on the Business Case would be\n* what the impact on the risks would be.\nThe priority should be re-evaluated by the Senior User after the impact analysis.\nFor Off-Specifications, the Project Manager tries to solve the problem within the\nstage and project tolerance margins. This may mean changes to the plan(s) to\ninclude extra activities. Where correction of the Off-Specification is not possible\nwithin tolerance levels, the Project Manager follows the exception procedures,\nEscalating Project Issues (CS8) and Producing an Exception Plan (SB6). If the\ndecision\nof the Project Board is to accept the Off-Specification without any corrective action,\nthis is called a ‘Concession’.\nThe Project Manager decides which Requests For Change, if any, should be\nimplemented within the current Stage Plan constraints. Even for those which the\nProject Manager is prepared to implement without extra funds or time, there should\nbe discussion with the Senior User and Senior Supplier. This is particularly\nimportant in circumstances involving an external Supplier. Without the approval of\nthe Project Board, the Project Manager should not authorise any work which would\nchange a product which has already been approved by the Project Board.\nWhere the Project Manager does not wish to take the decision personally on\nwhether or not to implement the changes, the relevant Project Issues are passed to\nthe Senior User(s). The Senior User can decide to reject Project Issues, put them in\n‘pending’ status, or ask for their implementation. Where implementation is sought,\nthe Senior User canvasses the Executive and Senior Supplier for their agreement to\nany extra cost and effort required. This may lead to more being rejected or put into\n‘pending’ status. The Project Issues are updated with any change in priority and the\nProject Board’s directives.\nThe Project Issues are returned to the Project Manager, the Issue Log updated, and\nan updated copy sent to the author.\n",
    "224": "Any Project Issues to be implemented form the basis of an Exception Report, the\ninput to Escalating Project Issues (CS8). According to the project environment, this\nmay be formal or informal. The likely outcome will be a request for the Project\nManager to produce an Exception Plan which will include the extra work, to be\nsubmitted via Producing an Exception Plan (SB6).\nNOTE: Where the Project Board has delegated decisions on the implementation\nof changes to some separate change authority, the name of this body should be\nsubstituted for that of the Project Board in this technique.\nHints and tips for change\nEvaluating the impact of potential changes can be erroneously taken to mean only\nthe impact on the Customer. Impact analysis must cover the three areas of Business,\nUser and Supplier. Before a change goes to the Senior User for consideration, the\nimpact on the Supplier must be known, e.g. the cost and effort required, and what\nproducts would have to be changed.\nWhere the project is partially or fully funded by the Supplier, this may change the\ndecision-making authority within the Project Board about changes. It may become\nmore of a joint decision based on the contract terms or including contract\nmodification. Any changes in responsibility and authority should be reflected in\nthe job definitions.\nWhere the project is part of a programme, is the project in a position to judge the\nimpact on other projects? Does it have the authority to make decisions? There are\ntwo potential approaches:\n* screen all changes at programme level to determine where the decision should be\n  made\n* ensure a programme representative is part of the project’s change control\n  authorisation loop.\n23    Quality Review techniques\nFundamental principles\nThe benefits to be gained from the effective use of Quality Reviews are:\n* a structured and organised approach to the examination of subjective quality\n  criteria\n* early identification of defects in products and, therefore, a platform for\n  product improvement with attendant reduction in the costs of the final\n  product during development and in operation\n* as products are considered complete once they have successfully passed\n  Quality Review, an objective measurement for management progress control\n  is provided; progress is measured by product delivery\n* all vested interests are working together to improve product quality; this\n  helps build the team approach to development\n* once a product has gone through the Quality Review procedure, personnel\n  are more willing to commit to that product. As ownership of the product is\n  shared between Quality Review participants, Users, who are represented on\n  the Quality Review team, are much more willing to sign off a reviewed\n  product\n* apart from defects on the part of the creator(s), defects may also be caused\n  by deficiencies in standards and methods. Failure to use a standard may\n  indicate that the standard is no longer practical to use. Such events should\n  instigate a review of the suspect standards area and provide a starting point\n  for standards improvements.\n",
    "225": "23.1    Context\nA Quality Review can be invoked at any point in the project, since any document\ncould be subject to a Quality Review if there are subjective elements of quality to be\nmonitored. It has close ties with the following processes:\n* Planning (PL) for the pre-planning and resourcing of major Quality Reviews\n* Managing Product Delivery (MP) which is the process covering the production\n  of the project’s products, and hence where the application of most of the\n  Quality Reviews will take place\n* Authorising Work Package (CSI) which addresses the hand-over of\n  responsibility for product production and will include the requirement for\n  Quality Reviews\n* Assessing Progress (CS2) which deals with progress monitoring and reporting,\n  and which will receive details of completed Quality Reviews.\n23.2     What is a Quality Review?\nA Quality Review is an involved partnership designed to ensure a product’s\ncompleteness and adherence to standards by a review procedure. It is a team\nreview of a product with the emphasis on checking the product for errors (as\nopposed to, for example, improved design). It has a clear structure, described in\nthis chapter.\n",

The most effective Quality Reviews have participants from all areas\nwhich can effectively contribute to the quality of the product.\nIt is possible to hold a postal review if it is impossible to get the reviewers together.\n23.2.2    The Deliverable\nThe deliverable, in the context of a Quality Review, is any product which has been\nevaluated against mostly subjective criteria involving elements of judgement or\nopinion. This will typically be a document, such as a plan, a report or a drawing,\nbut could be other products such as models, mock-ups or prototypes.\n23.3    Overview of the Quality Review procedure\n23.3.1    Objectives\nThe objectives of a Quality Review are:\n* to produce a product which meets business, user and specialist requirements\n* to assess the conformity of a product against set criteria\n* to provide a platform for product improvement\n* to involve all those who have a vested interest in the product\n* to spread ownership of the product\n* to obtain commitment from all vested interests in the product\n* to provide a mechanism for management control.\n23.3.2   Steps in the Quality Review procedure\nThe review procedure has a number of activities, the central element being the\nreview meeting, where all participants gather to identify and agree on any defects\nin the product.\nThere are three basic steps in the Quality Review procedure.\n* Preparation, consisting of:\n  - confirmation of the availability of the nominated reviewers and agreement\n    on dates for the return of comments and the review itself\n  - distribution of a copy of the product and its Product Description to\n    reviewers where this is possible, for instance if it is a printed document.\n    Alternatively, making the product available for inspection by the reviewers\n  - assessment of the product against the quality criteria\n  - entry of the major errors on an Error List\n  - annotation of minor errors on the product, where applicable\n  - return of the annotated product and Error List to the Producer\n  - a plan of the review meeting, and agreement on the agenda.\n* Review Meeting, consisting of:\n  - discussion and clarification of each of the major errors raised by the\n    reviewers\n  - agreement of the follow-up appropriate to each error\n  - documentation of the follow-up actions and responsibilities\n  - summary of the actions at the end of the meeting\n  - agreement on the Quality Review outcome, and sign-off of the product, if\n",
    "227": "    appropriate.\n* Follow-up, consisting of:\n  - notification to the Team Leader of Quality Review results\n  - a plan of any remedial work required\n  - sign-off of the product following successful remedial work.\nIt is important that Quality Reviews are properly planned. There is therefore an\nadditional Quality Review Planning step consisting of:\n* identifying the products which will be subject to Quality Review\n* planning the timescale for each Quality Review\n* identifying the reviewers and adding them to resource plans.\nThis is carried out as part of the Planning (PL) process.\nThe way these basic steps could be applied is as follows.\n23.3.3    Responsibilities\nThere are four specific roles involved in the Quality Review procedure.\nThe Review Chairman\nThis role runs the Quality Review procedure. This is a separate role from that of the\nExecutive, who chairs the Project Board.\nThe role has the following main responsibilities:\n* ensure that the Quality Review is properly organised\n* set the review meeting agenda\n* control the Quality Review procedure and chair the Quality Review meeting\n* ensure that the Quality Review does not stray from its main aim\n* ensure that actions and required results are agreed\n* together with the reviewers, determine the Quality Review outcome\n* keep the Team Manager aware of the status of all Quality Reviews\n* provide final review sign-off\n* institute exception procedures via the Team Manager where problems with the\n  product cannot be resolved satisfactorily.\nProducer\nThis role represents the creator(s) of the product involved. Typically it will be filled\nby the person who has produced the product, or who led the team responsible. The\nrole has the following responsibilities:\n* provide all reviewers with the relevant review products\n* prepare for the review meeting\n* assess Error Lists prior to the review meeting and use them to assist the\n  Chairman to set the review meeting agenda\n* answer questions about the product during the review procedure, explain\n  the implications of any errors, and take agreed errors forward for\n  subsequent action\n* agree action to resolve errors\n* ensure any agreed actions are carried out\n* obtain sign-off from reviewers for changes made to the product\n* obtain final sign-off from the Chairman when all changes have been\n   approved by the reviewers.\nReviewers\nThey have the following responsibilities:\n",
    "228": "* prepare for the review\n* assess the product against the quality criteria specified in the Product\n  Description\n* ensure errors are fully understood by the Producer and are subsequently\n  resolved satisfactorily\n* sign off Follow-up Action List items where the reviewers are identified as\n  checkers.\nScribe\nThe major responsibilities of this role are to:\n* take notes of agreed actions during the review meeting\n* read back agreed actions at the end of the meeting, and note who is to take\n  corrective action and who is to check the corrections.\nIn addition to the specific roles involved, there are responsibilities which need to be\ntaken by other people. These are responsibilities which form part of their standard\njob, but which are particularly relevant to the Quality Review process:\nProject Manager\n* plan the Quality Reviews in outline\n* plan to overcome any identified exception conditions raised as a result of a\n  Quality Review\n* act as reviewer where appropriate.\nTeam Leader\n* plan Quality Reviews in detail\n* identify Quality Review resources\n* monitor Quality Review progress against plan\n* report progress to Project Manager.\nNote that often the Project Manager will be directly managing the work which is\nbeing Quality Reviewed. If this is the case, the responsibilities of Project Manager\nand Team Leader will be combined.\nProject Assurance Roles\n* check that the Quality Reviews are being properly constituted\n* advise on suitable reviewers for each Quality Review\n* check that everyone involved with the Quality Review process is aware of\n  their role and responsibilities, and that adequate training has been given\n* ensure that the Quality Review procedure is being properly followed\n* check that reviewers are being correctly selected, and that they are being\n  correctly briefed for the work\n* check that follow-up actions are being properly monitored\n* log and report on corporate standards and advise on improvements and\n  amendments\n* act as reviewers where appropriate.\nProject Support Roles\nIf project support is available to the Project Manager, it can be used to assist the\nChairman in organising a review venue, prepare and distribute the review\ndocumentation, act as Scribe and progress-chase the Follow-up Action List until all\nerrors have been corrected and signed off. People in support roles can act as\nreviewers where appropriate.\nThe following tables show the detailed job contents for the Quality Review roles for\neach of the steps.\n",

If any of the reviewers is not prepared to sign off the\nproduct, then the product has not met its quality criteria, and hence is not ready for\nuse. If the reviewers’ comments cannot be resolved for any reason, e.g. contention\nbetween reviewers, the problem will have to be raised via a Project Issue (see\nChange Control).\nThe result of a Quality Review will normally be one of three:\n* the product is error-free and can be approved immediately\n* the product can be approved once the identified errors are corrected and\n  signed off\n* correction of the errors found will radically alter the product, and it should\n  be reviewed again.\nThe Chairman may also decide to postpone the review meeting if:\n* insufficient reviewers attend to cover the quality issues addressed by the\n  product’s quality criteria\n* the reviewers who are attending are not qualified to comment on the issues\n  being addressed\n* it is clear that the reviewers have not studied the product during the\n  Preparation phase\n* it becomes obvious that the product is not fit to be reviewed.\n23.3.5    Key criteria\n* Have the quality criteria been specified?\n* Have the quality criteria been passed to the reviewers, together with the\n  product?\n* Have the reviewers fully checked the product prior to the review meeting?\n* Have the Error Lists been sent to the Producer or Chairman prior to the\n  review meeting?\n* Has the review meeting concentrated on error detection, not error fixing?\n* Have the follow-up actions been documented and allocated?\n* Have reviewers been asked which changes they wish to sign off?\n* Has agreement been reached on the result of the Quality Review?\nHints and tips\nThere are various aspects which make the Quality Review process\nsuccessful:\nQuality Review is there for error/opportunity identification NOT correction.\nThe temptation to agree solutions for the defects found in a product can be all too\ninviting. The Qualify Review procedure is about identification and agreement of\ndefects. Should resolution become a feature of Quality Review, then the review\nprocedure will lose much of ifs effectiveness because discussion of solutions takes\ntime and effort away from the key objective of the Quality Review procedure i.e. the\nidentification and agreement of defects in the product, to provide the platform for\nproduct improvement. Also there may be more than one solution to a problem\nidentified and the group of people assembled to review a product may not be the\nbest qualified to select the best solution. Any solutions suggested during the review\nprocess should be noted for later consideration.\nThere is a need to address the Producer/reviewer psychology.\nThe aim of the Quality Review is to identify defects in the product not in the\n",
    "231": "producer. Reviewers and Producers should approach the review in a constructive\n‘team attitude’ to achieving quality products. If the team approach is not adopted,\nconflict can arise and be destructive to the Quality Review procedure. It helps if\nreviewers can refer to the product, rather than your product.\nThere must be management and peer pressure to prepare for the review\nmeeting.\nQuality Review is not an ad hoc gathering of individuals. It is not a first sight of\nthe product for the purpose of problem identification. As in all good meetings, all\nthe participants should attend having checked the product involved and should be\nprepared to contribute, knowing the agenda and objectives and the role they should\nperform at the meeting.\nQuality Review participants must prepare for the review by identifying major\nerrors on an Error List, annotating the product where possible with minor errors,\nand informing review participants of their findings. Not to do so wastes the time\nof the other reviewers, and devalues the eventual product sign-off since it is more\nlikely that errors will be left undiscovered.\nManagers do not attend.\nCare must be taken that managers do not attend a Quality Review in a people\nmanagement role. They do not attend to assess the performance of their staff.\nThis is particularly true of the Producer’s manager. It would devalue the meeting\nand would cause extra stress on the Producer. However, managers may attend in\nthe role of reviewers.\nChecklists should be in existence.\nA major means of assessing a product’s quality is through the Product Description\nwhich defines the composition, format and quality criteria of a product. Should\nthis not be available, a checklist of the standard criteria for this type of product\nshould be available. Without one or other of these, the reviewers will be left with\nno guidance as to what the acceptable quality is.\nThe Chairman should not act as a reviewer.\nIt is difficult to both chair the review meeting and review the product involved.\nideally the Chairman should be there just to run the meeting.\nNon-attendance of a reviewer.\nIf a reviewer cannot attend the meeting, the Chairman can decide either to accept\nan Error List from that reviewer and arrange for its points to be discussed at the\nmeeting, or replace the reviewer. If the number of non-attendees is such as to\nundermine the effectiveness of the review, either because of the lack of people to\nform discussions, or because of the lack of key skills, it may be necessary to postpone\nthe review meeting. Where reviewers are not prepared for the review or have not\nsubmitted Error Lists, it may be appropriate to postpone the review if it is felt that\nthe review might be ineffective.\nFor inter-project products, there should be cross-project representation at Quality\nReviews.\nThe suggested Scribe role can be taken by the Producer, especially in an informal\nQuality Review.\n24 Project filing techniques\nThis is a suggested filing system to be used by the project.\nThere are three major types of file in PRINCE:\n* Management\n* Specialist\n* Quality.\n",

The section should have its own log of entries, showing cross-\nreferences to the Configuration Items concerned.\n24.2.2    The Quality file\nThe objective of a Quality file is to permit an audit at any time of the quality work\nbeing done and to confirm adherence to quality standards. There is one Quality file\nwhich runs through the whole Project and is not divided into stages. It has three\nmajor divisions, Product Descriptions, Quality Checks and Project Issues.\nProduct Descriptions\nThe master copy of all Product Descriptions. There should be a Product Description\nfor every major product in the project.\nQuality Checks\nIt is useful to head this section with a log giving a number to each check, the type of\ncheck or test (e.g. Quality Review), the product and date. This is a quick reference to\nsee or show how many checks have been held in a particular stage and a guide to\nwhere the appropriate documentation can be found.\nThe sub-division of the quality section will depend on the type(s) of check or test\nbeing made. The filing for Quality Reviews, for example, should have separate\nsections for:\n* Invitations\n* Result notifications\n* Action lists.\nProject Issues\nThis should have a log, the Issue Log, at the front to facilitate sequential numbering\nand to record the status and allocation.

Each project has\nto decide on the level at which to stop breaking products down to further levels.\nApart from the example quoted at the beginning of this paragraph, other\nconsiderations are cost and effort. The greater the levels of breakdown, the greater\nthe control, but also the greater the cost and effort.\nB.2    Configuration Management and the Project\nSupport\n         Office\nBecause the final deliverable will exist after the project has finished, Configuration\nManagement is usually carried out on an organisation-wide basis, the same\napproach being used to look after both project and operational products. This is a\ngood reason for having Configuration Management in a Project Support Office,\nproviding the approach and expertise to all projects and operational products.\nThere may be a requirement for a project to fit in with existing approaches to\nConfiguration Management used by the Customer. Most end products from projects\nwill have a long, useful life, and will be modified many times during that life.\nConfiguration Management is essential to keep track of the changes. If the project\nhas been outsourced, the Configuration Management method used by the Supplier\nand any sub-contractors should be compatible with that of the Customer (or\nwhichever group will look after the product in its operational life).\n",
    "256": "B.3    Configuration Management coverage\nThe Configuration Management approach should cover all specialist products. The\nProject Manager decides whether the management and quality products should also\ncome within the scope of the Configuration Management approach.\nIf the decision is taken to exclude management products from the Configuration\nManagement approach, a means of document control will still need to be devised\nfor the management products, covering identification and version control.\nA Configuration Management approach may be manual or automated, whichever is\navailable and most appropriate for the project.\nNo hard and fast rules about the amount and formality of Configuration\nManagement needed by a project can be laid down. It depends on the type and size\nof the project and the project’s environment. But it is an issue which needs to be\nfaced at the outset of a project, and it will be needed to some extent.\nConfiguration Management is not optional. If more than one version of a product\nhas been created, then Configuration Management is being performed. It is just a\nquestion of how well it is being done. All the functions described below are\nnecessary for successful projects. Without Configuration Management, managers\nhave little or no control over the products being produced.\nB.3.1    Configuration Management functions\nThe four basic functions defined in the Components chapter on Configuration\nManagement can be broken down into the following steps:\n* identifying the individual products and product types of the final\n  deliverables; these products are referred to as configuration items\n* identifying those products which will be required in order to produce the\n  configuration items\n* establishing a coding system which will uniquely identify a configuration\n  item\n* identifying the ‘owner’ of a configuration item, the person to whom creation\n  or amendment of that configuration item has been delegated\n* recording, monitoring and reporting on the current status of each\n  configuration item as it progresses through its own specific lifecycle\n* filing all documentation produced during the development life of the\n  configuration item\n* retention of master copies of every completed configuration item\n* provision of procedures to ensure the safety and security of the\n  configuration items and to control access to them\n* distribution of copies of all configuration items and recording of any copy\n  holders\n* maintenance of relationships between configuration items so that no\n  configuration item is changed without being able to check for possible\n  impact on its neighbours\n* management of change to all configuration items, from receipt of Requests\n  For Change or Off-Specifications, through assessment of the impact of\n  proposed changes, release of a new version of the configuration items to be\n  changed, to the eventual receipt of the amended versions\n* ensuring that different versions of configuration items are uniquely\n  identified and that only the correct version is used in a given circumstance\n* establishment of baselines\n* performance of Configuration Audits. Normally the project assurance\n  function is responsible for Configuration Audits.\nConfiguration items which are of interest to more than one project maybe held\n",
    "257": "centrally within a Configuration Management method which applies to all the\naffected projects.\nItems can only be created, amended or deleted through submission of an approved\nProject Issue to the Configuration Librarian.\nB.4     Baselines\nA baseline is a complete and consistent set of configuration items which forms a\nfixed reference point in the development of the final product. The most obvious\nbaseline is the final product to be handed over at the end of the project.\nIt is normal to establish intermediate baselines to provide a firm, agreed foundation\nfor later work, preferably at natural break points in the development. The baseline\ndocument is a list of all configuration items which make up that release or baseline,\nshowing each item’s version number and date when the product was ‘frozen’.\nB.4.1    Individual Product Baseline\nAn individual product is said to be ‘baselined’ the moment when the product\npasses to the Configuration Library after approval by the Customer or the Project\nBoard. This changes its status and ‘freezes’ the content. The configuration item can\nnow be used as a firm basis for the development of any later product.\nIf the configuration item itself is to be changed at a later date, the baselined version\nis not changed. A new version number is allocated, a copy of the configuration item\nis issued bearing this new version number and the issue noted in the Configuration\nManagement method’s records.\nWhen this amended version is finished and has been approved, it is passed into the\nlibrary and a new baseline established. The old baselined version is never\ndiscarded. The Configuration Management method must always permit the\nrecreation of any version of the released deliverable.\nB.5     Configuration Management Plan\nThis plan forms part of the Project Initiation Document. It consists of:\n* an explanation of the purpose of Configuration Management\n* a description of (or reference to) the Configuration Management approach to\n  be used\n* highlighting any variance from corporate or organisational standards\n  together with a justification for the variance (for example, the decision might\n  be to use the Supplier’s Configuration Management method)\n* reference to any other Configuration Management systems with which links\n  will be necessary\n* identification of the Configuration Librarian\n* identification of the products or classes of product which will be\n  configuration items\n* a plan of what libraries, files and other locations will be used to hold\n  configuration items\n* confirmation that the relevant project and stage files have been set up.\nC     PRINCE and 1S0 9001:1994\nISO 9001 is the international standard for quality systems, issued under the\nauthority of the International Organisation for Standardisation (1S0). It applies to\nquality assurance in design/development, production, installation and servicing.\nThere are equivalent British and European quality standards which are currently\nidentical in wording to the international standard, although this may change in the\nfuture. The equivalence is:\n",
    "258": "International \nBritish \nEuropean\nIS0 9001 \nBS EN ISO 9001 \nEN ISO 9001\nISO 9002 \nBS EN ISO 9002 \nEN ISO 9002\nIS0 9003 \nBS EN ISO 9003 \nEN ISO 9003\nQuality applies to two areas of production, the product itself and the processes\nwhich give rise to the product. The international standards vocabulary (IS0 8402)\ndefines quality as:\n‘The totality of features and characteristics of a product or service\nwhich bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs’\nWidely used informal interpretations of this definition are:\n* quality of a product is its suitability for the purpose for which it is intended.\n  Products include both services and tangible items\n* quality of a process is its ability to deliver its products in a trouble-free way.\nThe quality standard IS0 9001 can be used by a company when:\n* setting up a quality assurance function\n* examining the quality assurance system of a Supplier.\nPRINCE is not and was not designed to be a comprehensive quality system.\nHowever, three of its constituents contribute to a significant part of such a system.\nThese are:\n* quality controls which are clearly defined technical and management\n  procedures\n* product-based planning and the Product Descriptions which define the\n  product quality criteria\n* the PRINCE organisation.\nIS0 9001 prescribes what should be done within a quality system, but does not say\nhow it should be done. For a quality system to conform to IS0 9001, it must satisfy\neach of the twenty clauses and associated sub-clauses of the standard relevant to\nthe environment in which the quality system operates. This Appendix looks at the\nrequirements of the quality standard. Each part of IS0 9001 is briefly defined,\nfollowed by how PRINCE can contribute to meeting each requirement. The\nrequirements are presented with the same numbering system and in the order in\nwhich they appear in IS0 9001.\nC.1     Management Responsibility (4.1)\nC.1.1    Quality Policy\nRequirement\nThe Supplier’s management with executive responsibility shall define and\ndocument its policy with respect to quality.\nPRINCE approach\nThe corporate or programme quality policy should include the use of PRINCE as\nthe standard project management method.\nC.1.2    Organisation\n",
    "259": "Responsibility and authority\nRequirement\nThe responsibility, authority and interrelation of all personnel who manage,\nperform and verify work affecting quality must be defined and documented.\nParticularly, personnel who need the organisational freedom and authority to:\n* initiate action to prevent product, process and quality system non-conformity\n* identify and record product, process and quality system problems\n* initiate, recommend or provide solutions\n* verify the implementation of solutions\n* control further processing, delivery or installation of a non-conforming\n  product until the satisfactory condition has been corrected.\nPRINCE approach\nThis would normally be a responsibility of a quality assurance function which sits\nabove all projects.\nWithin a project this requirement is fully satisfied. The Organisation roles contain\nresponsibilities/authority for quality. Part of Start-up is the allocation of these roles\nto individuals.\nThe Quality Review technique clearly defines the responsibilities listed above for a\nquality check of an individual product.\nResources\nRequirement\nThe Supplier shall identify resource requirements and provide adequate resources\nincluding the assignment of trained personnel for management, performance or\nwork and verification activities, including quality audits.\nPRINCE approach\nWithin the context of projects, the verification aspect of this requirement is\naddressed. The PRINCE Stage Quality Plan contains details of each quality check,\nwho will attend and perform which role.\nAny specific responsibilities within a project for corrective actions would be defined\nin the job descriptions.\nManagement representative\nRequirement\nThe Supplier shall appoint a management representative who shall ensure that the\nrequirements of the standard are implemented and maintained.\nPRINCE approach\nThis is intended for a higher level than individual project control. Within a project\nthis responsibility can be allocated within one of the Project Board roles.\nManagement Review\nRequirement\nThere should be a regular review of the Quality System to ensure its continuing\nsuitability and effectiveness.\n",
    "260": "PRINCE approach\nThe update of the Lessons Learned Report throughout the project goes some way to\nmeeting the requirement of a regular review, but it should really be a corporate-wide\nquality assurance function to fully meet the requirement.\nThe logging and filing of quality checking documentation provides the records for\nCustomer inspection. The assurance responsibilities of the Project Board can be\ntailored to ensure that any review of the quality records is allocated to one or more\nCustomer representatives.\nC.2    Quality System (4.2)\nC.2.1    Requirement\nThe Supplier shall establish and maintain a documented Quality System as a means\nof ensuring that products conform to specified requirements. This shall include:\n* the preparation of documented Quality System procedures\n* the effective implementation of the quality system and its documented\n  procedures\n* documented quality planning activities.\nA supplier should be able to demonstrate compliance with the Quality System.\nC.2.2    PRINCE approach\nThis requirement is not addressed in full. PRINCE presents a framework of\nprocedures and a model organisation structure which enforces adherence to\nprocedures. The adoption, therefore, of PRINCE contributes a major part of the\nQuality System.\nAs part of the quality organisation there may be a separate, independent quality\nassurance function which oversees implementation of the Quality System by\nprojects.\nThe Project Initiation Document contains the Project Quality Plan of the project. The\nProject Mandate and Project Brief look for a statement of the customer’s quality\nexpectations.\nThe project organisation defines the quality responsibilities. In particular, the\nProject Board roles contain responsibilities for assurance. A Project Board may wish\nto delegate certain of their assurance responsibilities to a permanent quality\nassurance group when the roles are being converted into job descriptions.\nInclusion of quality activities in Stage Plans demonstrates that procedures are being\nfollowed. Planning steps recommend that the assurance functions are involved in\nidentifying quality checks and participants at stage planning time. This allows\ndemonstration of compliance with the Quality System.\nThe Quality Review output demonstrates that services conform to specification.\nThe Quality Log and filing of the quality check documents provides an audit trail of\nthe quality work carried out, again demonstrating compliance.\nC.3    Contract Review (4.3)\nC.3.1    Requirement\n",
    "261": "The Supplier shall establish and maintain documented procedures for contract\nreview. Each tender, order or contract shall be reviewed by the supplier to ensure\nthat:\n* the requirements are adequately defined and documented\n* any differences between the contract or order requirements and those in the\n  tender are resolved\n* the Supplier is capable of meeting the contract or order requirements.\nA procedure for control of amendments to contract should be defined and\ndocumented and records of contract reviews should be maintained.\nC.3.2     PRINCE approach\nThis requirement is partially satisfied. Where there is no formal contract, the\nacceptance of the Project Initiation Document by the Project Board is a confirmation\nof the Supplier’s ability to carry out the Customer’s requirements.\nThe monitoring and review of changing requirements is controlled in PRINCE by\nthe Project Issue procedure. In the case of exceptions or deviations, the Project\nBoard has the authority to either commit further resources to maintain the\nSupplier’s ability to deliver or reduce the scope of the project. The involvement of\nthe Senior User and anyone to whom any of that role’s assurance responsibilities\nare delegated ensures liaison with the purchaser’s (Customer ‘s) organisation.\nC.4     Design Control (4.4)\nC.4.1    General\nRequirement\nThe Supplier shall establish and maintain documented procedures to control and\nverify the design of the product in order to ensure that the specified requirements\nare met.\nPRINCE approach\nAll the requirements of this clause are satisfied or addressed in the following sub-\nparagraphs.\nC.4.2    Design and development planning\nRequirement\nThe Supplier shall prepare plans for each design and development activity that\ndefine responsibility for their implementation. These activities shall be assigned to\nqualified personnel with adequate resources. Plans shall be updated as the design\nevolves.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is mostly satisfied. PRINCE defines the management organisation\nand responsibilities in the Project Initiation Document.\nEach Work Package authorised by the Project Manager identifies the responsibility\nfor that work. Each Stage and Team Plan identifies the responsibility for each\nactivity.\nThe Stage or Team Plans show the assignment of personnel to activities. They also\nspecify the necessary equipment and facilities.\n",
    "262": "PRINCE procedures and role descriptions would require addition to embrace\nrelevant staff qualifications.\nThe updating of plans is carried out on a regular basis in the process Controlling a\nStage (CS) and also occurs during Managing stage Boundaries (SB).\nC.4.3    Organisational and technical interfaces\nRequirement\nOrganisational and technical interfaces between different groups which input into\nthe design process shall be defined and the necessary information documented,\ntransmitted and regularly reviewed.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is fully satisfied. The interfaces between groups and the job\ndescriptions for the various PRINCE roles are defined and documented in the\nProject Initiation Document.\nThe interfaces are reviewed at the following meetings:\n* Project Initiation\n* Stage Assessments\n* Project Closure.\nC.4.4    Design input\nRequirement\nDesign input requirements relating to the product, including applicable statutory\nand regulatory requirements, shall be identified, documented and reviewed by the\nSupplier for adequacy. Incomplete, ambiguous or conflicting requirements shall be\nresolved with those responsible for imposing these requirements.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is fully satisfied. The Product Description for design input\nrequirements would state its content, form and quality criteria. Any problems\nwould be raised at its Quality Review which representatives of the Customer and\nSupplier would attend. Any changes to the design requirements document would\nbe controlled under change control and Configuration Management.\nC.4.5    Design output\nRequirement\nDesign output shall be documented and expressed in terms that can be verified and\nvalidated against input requirements. Design output shall:\n* meet the design input requirements\n* contain or make reference to acceptance criteria\n* identify those characteristics of the design which are crucial to the safe and\n  proper functioning of the product.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is partially satisfied.\nQuality criteria within Product Descriptions allow the:\n",
    "263": "* definition of the need for products to conform to legislative requirements\n  and meet the design requirements\n* inclusion of acceptance criteria to meet the above list.\nC.4.6     Design Review\nRequirement\nAt appropriate stages of design, formal documented reviews of the design results\nshall be planned and conducted.  Records of the reviews shall be maintained.\nPRINCE approach\nThe requirement is satisfied. The Quality Review technique allows the assembly of\nthe appropriate personnel to carry out a formal review to check that the design\noutput meets the requirements and to document the findings.\nC.4.7     Design verification\nRequirement\nAt appropriate stages of design, verification shall be performed to ensure that the\noutput meets the design stage input requirement by means of appropriate control\nmeasures.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is satisfied as part of the Quality Review procedures; unless the\ndesign passes its quality check, it is not accepted under configuration control.\nC.4.8    Design validation\nRequirement\nDesign validation shall be performed to ensure that products conform to defined\nuser needs and/or requirements. It follows successful design verification and is\nnormally performed under defined operating conditions.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is fully satisfied. The assurance responsibilities of the Senior User\nensure that the validation requirements for products are defined and met. In Project\nClosure the Project Manager has to provide confirmation of the acceptance of the\nproduct by the User with evidence of successful validation.\nC.4.9     Design changes\nRequirement\nAll design changes and notifications shall be identified, documented, reviewed and\napproved by authorised personnel before their implementation.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is fully satisfied. The Project Issue and Configuration\nManagement procedures ensure that all the design documents are subject to change\ncontrol, and thus any changes are subject to review and approval.\n",
    "264": "C.5     Document and Data Control (4.5)\nC.5.1     Requirement\nThe Supplier shall establish and maintain procedures to control all documents and\ndata which relate to the requirements of IS0 9001. The documents and data shall be\nreviewed and approved for adequacy by authorised personnel prior to issue. The\ncurrent revision status of documents shall be established to preclude the use of\ninvalid and/or obsolete documents. Versions of documents are to be available\nwhere needed and obsolete copies promptly withdrawn. Changes to documents\nshall be reviewed by the same functions which performed the original review and\napproval, unless specifically designated otherwise.\nC.5.2     PRINCE approach\nThis requirement is fully satisfied by product control within the project. The Project\nIssue technique covers the review of any changes, but product control or\nConfiguration Management procedures are required to fully handle the issue of\ncopies and withdrawal of obsolete ones.\nA Configuration Management method is needed to fully meet this quality\nrequirement. Because there are so many automated and manual implementations of\nConfiguration Management, this is regarded as being outside the scope of the\nproject management method. The Configuration Management method to be used is\ndefined in the Project Initiation Document.\nC.6     Purchasing (4.6)\nC.6.1    Requirement\nThe Supplier shall establish and maintain documented procedures to ensure that\npurchased products conform to specified requirements.\nC.6.2    PRINCE approach\nProduct Descriptions would include the quality criteria for purchased products, just\nas they would for internal products. Purchased products would be required to pass\nthe same quality inspections as internal products. The checking requirements would\nbe part of the Work Package Authorisation.\nThis would also be a prime target for whoever carries out the assurance\nresponsibilities defined for the Senior Supplier.\nC.7    Control of Customer-Supplied Product (4.7)\nC.7.1    Requirement\nThe Supplier shall establish and maintain documented procedures for the control of\nverification, storage and maintenance of purchaser-supplied products.\nC.7.2     PRINCE Approach\nOnly the verification part of this requirement is addressed.\nDesign reviews and testing requirements for Customer-supplied products are\ndefined as part of the Work Package Authorisation.\n",

Where traceability is specified,\nthere should be documented procedures to enable the identification of individual\nproducts or batches.\nC.8.2    PRINCE approach\nThis requirement is fully satisfied through:\n* Product Breakdown Structures, Product Flow Diagrams and Product\n  Descriptions which state the types of product to be produced, how they are\n  derived and how they may be identified\n* Configuration Management procedures which identify individual items and\n  their relationship with other items\n* change control procedures which ensure that any changes to requirements\n  are properly authorised and reflected throughout all relevant products.\nC.9     Process control (4.9)\nC.9.1    Requirement\nThe Supplier shall identify and plan the production, installation and servicing\nprocesses which directly affect quality and shall ensure that these processes are\ncarried out under controlled conditions. Controlled conditions shall include:\n* documented procedures\n* use of suitable maintained equipment and compliance with standards, etc.\n* monitoring and control of process and product characteristics\n* the approval of processes and equipment\n* stipulating the criteria for workmanship.\nC.9.2     PRINCE approach\nWithin a PRINCE project this requirement is partially satisfied. Product\nDescriptions must include:\n* references to procedures, standards or working practices, i.e. documented\n  work instructions, and to special processes\n* quality criteria, i.e. criteria for workmanship.\nC.10     Inspection and Testing (4.10)\nC.10.1    General\nRequirement\nThe supplier shall establish and maintain documented procedures for inspection\nand testing activities in order to verify that the specified requirements for the\nproduct are met\nPRINCE approach\nThe requirements of this clause are addressed in the following sub-paragraphs.\n",

When the need for the incoming product has been\nidentified, a Product Description is written which must specify the verification and\ntesting required.\nC.10. 3     In-process inspection and testing\nRequirement\nThe Supplier shall:\n* inspect, test and identify products as required by the quality plan and/or\n  documented procedures\n* hold products until the required inspection and tests have been completed.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is fully satisfied. Required tests, inspections and associated\nprocedures are specified with the Product Descriptions. The quality plan is\nincorporated into the Stage and Team Plans.\nPRINCE recommends the Quality Review as one mechanism for checking test\nresults. The objective of a Quality Review is to establish conformance to\nrequirements, the results being recorded in the Follow-up Action List and Result\nNotification.\nNon-conforming products are identified:\n* through outstanding errors following a Quality Review\n* as Off-Specifications by the Project Issue procedure.\nC.10.4     Final inspection and testing\nRequirement\nThe supplier shall carry out all final inspection and testing in accordance with the\nquality plan and/or documented procedures. The quality plan and/or documented\nprocedures shall require that all specified reviews and tests are carried out, that the\nresults meet specified requirements and that the associated data and documentation\nis available and authorised, before the product is released to a Customer.\nPRINCE approach\nThis requirement is partially satisfied.\nThe documented procedures and techniques of PRINCE, the Project Quality Plan\nand the Stage Quality Plans fully meet the requirement for final testing, including\nCustomer acceptance testing.

    "269": "C.16.2     PRINCE approach\nThe retention of quality checking documentation plus the maintenance of a Quality\nLog fulfil this requirement.\nThe feedback of progress information from the Teams provides a channel for\nobtaining the necessary information. According to the type of project there may be a\nneed for other types of quality checking. PRINCE does not attempt to define these,\nbut its planning and control structure gives a platform on which extra types of\ncheck can be built. These can be compared to the feedback and audit trail from\nQuality Reviews to ensure that they provide the same information.

It is the authority which signs off the completion of each stage as\nwell as authorises the start of the next stage. It ensures that required resources are\ncommitted and arbitrates on any conflicts within the project or negotiates a solution\nto any problems between the project and external bodies. In addition, it approves the\nappointment and responsibilities of the Project Manager and any delegation of its\nproject assurance responsibilities.\nThe Project Board has the following responsibilities. It is a general list and will need\ntailoring for a specific project.\nAt the beginning of the project:\n* assurance that the Project Initiation Document complies with relevant\n  Customer standards and policies, plus any associated contract with the\n  Supplier\n* agreement with the Project Manager on that person’s responsibilities and\n  objectives\n* confirmation with corporate or programme management of project\n  tolerances\n",

According to the size, complexity\nand risk of the project, the Project Board may decide to delegate some of this project\nassurance responsibility. Later in this Appendix project assurance is defined in more\ndetail.\nOne Project Board responsibility which should receive careful consideration is that\nof approving and funding changes. The chapter on Change Control should be read\nbefore finalising this responsibility of approving and funding changes.\nResponsibilities of specific members of the Project Board are described in the\nrespective sections below.\nD.2     Executive\nThe Executive is ultimately responsible for the project, supported by the Senior User\nand Senior Supplier. The Executive has to ensure that the project is value for money,\nensuring a cost-conscious approach to the project, balancing the demands of business,\nUser and Supplier.\nThroughout the project the Executive ‘owns’ the Business Case.\nD.2.1    Specific responsibilities\n* Ensure that a tolerance is set for the project in the Project Brief\n* authorise Customer expenditure and set stage tolerances\n* approve the End Project Report and Lessons Learned Report\n* brief corporate or programme management about project progress\n* organise and chair Project Board Meetings\n",
    "272": "* recommend future action on the project to corporate or programme\n  management if the project tolerance is exceeded\n* approve the sending of the notification of project closure to corporate or\n  programme management.\nThe Executive is responsible for overall business assurance of the project, i.e. that it\nremains on target to deliver products which will achieve the expected business\nbenefits, and the project will complete within its agreed tolerances for budget and\nschedule. Business assurance covers:\n* validation and monitoring of the Business Case against external events and\n  against project progress\n* keeping the project in line with Customer strategies\n* monitoring project finance on behalf of the Customer\n* monitoring the business risks to ensure that these are kept under control\n* monitoring any Supplier and contractor payments\n* monitoring changes to the Project Plan to see if there is any impact on the\n  needs of the business or the project Business Case\n* assessing the impact of potential changes on the Business Case and Project\n  Plan\n* constraining User and Supplier excesses\n* informing the project of any changes caused by a programme of which the\n  project is part (this responsibility may be transferred if there is other\n  programme representation on the Project Management Team)\n* monitoring stage and project progress against the agreed tolerances.\nIf the project warrants it, the Executive may delegate some responsibility for the\nabove business assurance functions.\nD.3    Senior User\nThe Senior User is responsible for the specification of the needs of all those who will\nuse the final product(s), User liaison with the project team and for monitoring that\nthe solution will meet those needs within the constraints of the Business Case.\nThe role represents the interests of all those who will use the final product(s) of the\nproject, those for whom the product will achieve an objective, or those who will use\nthe product to deliver benefits. The Senior User role commits User resources and\nmonitors products against requirements. This role may require more than one\nperson to cover all the User interests. For the sake of effectiveness the role should\nnot be split between too many people.\nD.3.1     Specific responsibilities\n* Ensure the desired outcome of the project is specified\n* make sure that progress towards the outcome required by the Users remains\n  consistent from the User perspective\n* promote and maintain focus on the desired project outcome\n* ensure that any User resources required for the project are made available\n* approve Product Descriptions for those products which act as inputs or\n  outputs (interim or final) from the Supplier function, or will affect them\n  directly and that the products are signed off once completed\n* prioritise and contribute User opinions on Project Board decisions on\n  whether to implement recommendations on proposed changes\n* resolve User requirements and priority conflicts\n* provide the User view on recommended follow-up actions\n* brief and advise User management on all matters concerning the project.\nThe assurance responsibilities of the Senior User are that:\n* specification of the User’s needs is accurate, complete and unambiguous\n* development of the solution at all stages is monitored to ensure that it will\n  meet the User’s needs and is progressing towards that target\n",
    "273": "* impact of potential changes is evaluated from the User point of view\n* risks to the Users are constantly monitored\n* testing of the product at all stages has the appropriate User representation\n* quality control procedures are used correctly to ensure products meet User\n  requirements\n* User liaison is functioning effectively.\nWhere the project’s size, complexity or importance warrants it, the Senior User may\ndelegate the responsibility and authority for some of the assurance responsibilities to\na User assurance role.\nD.4     Senior Supplier\nRepresents the interests of those designing, developing, facilitating, procuring,\nimplementing, operating and maintaining the project products. The Senior Supplier\nrole must have the authority to commit or acquire Supplier resources required.\nIt should be noted that in some environments the Customer may share design\nauthority or have a major say in it.\nIf necessary more than one person may be required to represent the Suppliers.\nD.4.1    Specific responsibilities\n* Agree objectives for specialist activities\n* make sure that progress towards the outcome remains consistent from the\n  Supplier perspective\n* promote and maintain focus on the desired project outcome from the point\n  of view of Supplier management\n* ensure that the Supplier resources required for the project are made\n  available\n* approve Product Descriptions for specialist products\n* contribute Supplier opinions on Project Board decisions on whether to\n  implement recommendations on proposed changes\n* resolve Supplier requirements and priority conflicts\n* arbitrate on, and ensure resolution of any specialist priority or resource\n  conflicts\n* brief non-technical management on specialist aspects of the project.\nThe Senior Supplier is responsible for the specialist integrity of the project. The\nspecialist assurance role responsibilities are to:\n* advise on the selection of specialist strategy, design and methods\n* ensure that any specialist and operating standards defined for the project are\n  met and used to good effect\n* monitor potential changes and their impact on the correctness, completeness\n  and integrity of products against their Product Description from a specialist\n  perspective\n* monitor any risks in the specialist and production aspects of the project\n* ensure quality control procedures are used correctly so that products adhere\n  to specialist requirements.\nIf warranted, some of this assurance responsibility may be delegated to separate\nspecialist assurance personnel. Depending on the particular Customer/Supplier\nenvironment of a project, the Customer may also wish to appoint people to specialist\nassurance roles.\nD.5     Project Manager\nThe Project Manager has the authority to run the project on a day-to-day basis on\nbehalf of the Project Board within the constraints laid down by the board. In a\n",
    "274": "Customer/Supplier environment the Project Manager will normally come from the\nCustomer organisation, but there will be projects where the Project Manager comes\nfrom the Supplier. A typical example would be an in-house project, where the\nCustomer and Supplier belong to the same organisation. In the latter case the\nCustomer may appoint a ‘Project Director’ or ‘Controller’ to be its day-to-day liaison\nwith the Project Manager.\nThe Project Manager’s prime responsibility is to ensure that the project produces the\nrequired products, to the required standard of quality and within the specified\nconstraints of time and cost, The Project Manager is also responsible for the project\nproducing a result which is capable of achieving the benefits defined in the Business\nCase.\nD.5.1     Specific responsibilities\n* Manage the production of the required products\n* direct and motivate the project team\n* plan and monitor the project\n* agree any delegation and use of project assurance roles required by the\n  Project Board\n* produce the Project Initiation Document\n* prepare Project, Stage and, if necessary, Exception Plans in conjunction with\n  Team Leaders and appointed project assurance roles, and agree them with\n  the Project Board\n* manage business and project risks, including the development of\n  contingency plans\n* liaise with programme management if the project is part of a programme\n* liaise with programme management or related projects to ensure that work\n  is neither overlooked nor duplicated\n* take responsibility for overall progress and use of resources, and initiate\n  corrective action where necessary\n* be responsible for change control and any required Configuration\n  Management\n* report to the Project Board through Highlight Reports and stage assessments\n* liaise with the Project Board or its appointed project assurance roles to\n  assure the overall direction and integrity of the project\n* agree technical and quality strategy with appropriate members of the Project\n  Board\n* prepare the Lessons Learned Report\n* prepare any Follow-on Action Recommendations required\n* prepare the End Project Report\n* identify and obtain any support and advice required for the management,\n  planning and control of the project\n* be responsible for project administration\n* liaise with any Suppliers or account managers.\nD.6    Team Manager\nThe use of this role is optional. The Project Manager may find that it is beneficial to\ndelegate the authority and responsibility for planning the creation of certain\nproducts and managing a team of specialists to produce those products. There are\nmany reasons why it may be decided to employ this role. Some of these are the size\nof the project, the particular specialist skills or knowledge needed for certain\nproducts, geographical location of some team members, and the preferences of the\nProject Board.\nThe Team Manager’s prime responsibility is to ensure production of those products\ndefined by the Project Manager to an appropriate quality, in a timescale and at a\ncost acceptable to the Project Board. The Team Manager reports to and takes direction\nfrom the Project Manager.\nThe use of this role should be discussed by the Project Manager with the Project\n",
    "275": "Board and, if the role is required, planned at Project Initiation time.\nD.6.1    Specific responsibilities\n* Prepare plans for the team’s work and agree these with the Project Manager\n* receive authorisation from the Project Manager to create products (Work\n  Package)\n* manage the team\n* direct, motivate, plan and monitor the team work\n* take responsibility for the progress of the team’s work and use of team\n  resources, and initiate corrective action where necessary within the\n  constraints laid down by the Project Manager\n* advise the Project Manager of any deviations from plan, recommend\n  corrective action and help prepare any appropriate Exception Plans\n* pass products which have been completed and approved in line with the\n  agreed Work Package requirements back to the Project Manager\n* ensure all Project Issues are properly reported to the person maintaining the\n  Issue Log\n* ensure the evaluation of Project Issues which arise within the team’s work\n  and recommend action to the Project Manager\n* liaise with any project assurance roles\n* attend any stage assessments as directed by the Project Manager\n* arrange and lead team checkpoints\n* ensure that quality controls of the team’s work are planned and performed\n  correctly\n* maintain, or ensure the maintenance of team files\n* identify and advise the Project Manager of any risks associated with a Work\n  Package\n* ensure that such risks are entered on the Risk Log\n* manage specific risks as directed by the Project Manager.\nD.7    Project Assurance\nThe Project Board members do not work full-time on the project, therefore they\nplace a great deal of reliance on the Project Manager. Although they receive regular\nreports from the Project Manager, there may always be the questions at the back of\ntheir minds, ‘Are things really going as well as we are being told?’, ‘Are any\nproblems being hidden from us?’, ‘Is the solution going to be what we want?’, ‘Are\nwe suddenly going to find that the project is over-budget or late?’ There are other\nquestions. The Supplier may have a quality assurance function charged with the\nresponsibility to check that all projects are adhering to the Quality System.\nAll of these points mean that there is a need in the project organisation for an\nindependent monitoring of all aspects of the project’s performance and products.\nThis is the project assurance function.\nTo cater for a small project, PRINCE starts by identifying these project assurance\nfunctions as part of the role of each Project Board member. According to the needs\nand desires of the Project Board, any of these assurance responsibilities can be\ndelegated, as long as the recipients are independent of the Project Manager and the\nrest of the Project Management Team. Any appointed assurance jobs assure the\nproject on behalf of one or more members of the Project Board.\nIt is not mandatory that all assurance roles are delegated. Each of the assurance roles\nwhich is delegated may be assigned to one individual or shared. The Project Board\ndecides when an assurance role needs to be delegated. It maybe for the entire project\nor only part of it. The person or persons filling an assurance role may be changed\nduring the project at the request of the Project Board. Any use of assurance roles\nneeds to be planned at Initiation Stage, otherwise resource usage and costs for\nassurance could easily get out of control.\nThere is no stipulation on how many assurance roles there must be. Each Project\n",
    "276": "Board role has assurance responsibilities. Again, each project should determine\nwhat support, if any, each Project Board role needs to achieve this assurance.\nFor example, the Supplier’s work standards may be certificated under IS0 9001. A\nrequirement of the certification is that there will be some form of quality assurance\nfunction which is required to monitor the Supplier’s work. Some of the Senior\nSupplier’s assurance responsibilities may be delegated to this function. Note that\nthey would only be delegated. The Project Board member retains accountability.\nAny delegation should be documented. The quality assurance could include\nverification by an external party that the Project Board is performing its functions\ncorrectly.\nAssurance covers all interests of a project, including Business, User and Supplier.\nProject assurance has to be independent of the Project Manager, therefore the Project\nBoard cannot delegate any of its assurance responsibilities to the Project Manager.\nD.7.1     Specific responsibilities\nThe implementation of the assurance responsibilities needs to answer the question\n‘What is to be assured?’ A list of possibilities would include:\n* maintenance of thorough liaison throughout the project between the Supplier\n  and the Customer\n* User needs and expectations are being met or managed\n* risks are being controlled\n* adherence to the Business Case\n* constant reassessment of the value-for-money solution\n* fit with the overall programme or company strategy\n* the right people being involved\n* an acceptable solution is developed\n* project remains viable\n* the scope of the project is not ‘creeping up’ unnoticed\n* focus on the business need is maintained\n* internal and external communications are working\n* applicable standards are being used\n* any legislative constraints are being observed\n* the needs of specialist interests, e.g. security, are being observed\n* adherence to quality assurance standards.\nIt is not enough to believe that standards will be obeyed. It is not enough to ensure\nthat a project is well set up and justified at the outset. All the aspects listed above\nneed to be checked throughout the project as part of ensuring that it remains\nconsistent with and continues to meet a business need and that no change to the\nexternal environment affects the validity of the project.\nD.8     Project Support\nThe provision of any project support on a formal basis is optional. It is driven by the\nneeds of the individual project and Project Manager. Project support could be in the\nform of advice on project management tools, guidance and administrative services\nsuch as filing, and the collection of actuals, to one or more related projects. Where set\nup as an official body, project support can act as a repository for lessons learned, and\na central source of expertise in specialist support tools.\nOne support function which must be considered is that of Configuration\nManagement. Depending on the project size and environment, there may be a need\nto formalise this, and it quickly becomes a task with which the Project Manager\ncannot cope without support. See the chapter on Configuration Management for\ndetails of the work.\n",
